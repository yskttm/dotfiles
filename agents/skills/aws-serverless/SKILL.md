# AWS Serverless

Domain expertise for building serverless applications on AWS: Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions, EventBridge, event source mappings, concurrency, cold starts, deployment, and troubleshooting.

**Works best with** the [AWS MCP server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mcp/) — run CLI commands, query CloudWatch, validate configs directly. All guidance also works with standard AWS CLI access.

## Specialized skills — check these first

These cover capabilities and procedures the general references below do **not**. Several are specialized features or step-by-step tested procedures you would otherwise miss. Route to the matching skill before falling back to the references.

### Advanced Lambda compute (easy to overlook)

| Use this skill | When the workload involves |
|---|---|
| **aws-lambda-microvms** | Strong tenant isolation, sandboxed/untrusted code execution (AI agent code sandboxes, REPLs, notebooks, CI runners), long-lived sessions, suspend/resume with preserved state, port-listening servers (gRPC, WebSocket, custom TCP), Firecracker microVMs, snapshot-resumable compute, up to 8-hour lifetimes |
| **aws-lambda-durable-functions** | Durable execution, checkpoint-and-replay, long-running multi-step workflows written as plain code (TS/Python/Java), automatic state persistence, saga pattern in code, human-in-the-loop callbacks, executions up to 1 year, `context.step`/`context.wait`/`context.invoke`, `withDurableExecution`, `durable-execution-sdk` |
| **aws-lambda-managed-instances** | Lambda Managed Instances (LMI), capacity providers, EC2-backed Lambda, steady high-volume traffic (50M+ req/mo) wanting Savings Plans / Reserved Instance pricing, `PerExecutionEnvironmentMaxConcurrency`, `CapacityProviderConfig`, multi-concurrent execution environments |

### Workflow orchestration

Route here when the user wants to coordinate multiple steps, services, or functions. Triggers include "orchestration", "workflow", "state machine", "multi-step coordination", "coordinate Lambda functions", "durable execution", "pipeline with retries", or intent to build saga/compensation, human-in-the-loop approval, fan-out, or long-running async coordination.

When starting a new orchestration or multi-step workflow, you MUST surface the choice between AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda Durable Functions before implementing — do not silently pick one. Route on the signals below. When the request names only a generic pattern (saga/compensation, human-in-the-loop, fan-out, or "workflow orchestration") with no technology, present both options and the one-line tradeoff, then let the user decide. Do not lead with the tradeoff caveats when the signals already point to one service.

| Use this skill | When the workload involves |
|---|---|
| **aws-step-functions** | Orchestration whose primary work is calling AWS services directly; coordinating non-Lambda compute (ECS/Fargate, Glue, SageMaker, Batch) through native managed integrations; a visual, auditable workflow definition required for compliance, cross-team operational observability, or as a shared contract between teams that do not share a codebase (ASL is the specification, not application code); authoring or editing state machines and Amazon States Language (ASL) — state types, JSONata data transformation, Retry/Catch error handling, `.sync`/`waitForTaskToken` service integrations, Distributed Map, TestState unit testing, JSONPath-to-JSONata migration |
| **aws-lambda-durable-functions** | Code-first orchestration in-process when already building on Lambda (`context.step`/`context.wait`/`context.invoke`, `withDurableExecution`); many fine-grained steps per execution where cumulative Step Functions Standard state-transition cost may be significant — compare Step Functions pricing (Standard vs Express) against Lambda invocation cost at the expected volume before choosing; orchestration steps written in a general-purpose language within the same application codebase (share modules, data types, and test suites with application code); teams applying standard software-engineering practices (unit tests, code review, type checking) to orchestration logic without learning a declarative workflow language |

**Tradeoff (use when either fits):** Durable Functions keeps orchestration in your Lambda codebase; Step Functions externalizes it into a managed, visual state machine with built-in service integrations.

**Security:** Both services persist workflow state and payloads — Step Functions records full input/output in execution history (viewable in the console and, if logging is enabled, CloudWatch Logs). As a baseline, enable execution logging (CloudTrail) and CloudWatch alarms on execution failures, and use least-privilege per-workflow execution roles. Do not pass secrets, tokens, or PII through workflow state; reference them by Secrets Manager/ARN pointer, and apply a customer-managed KMS key to encrypt state when the data is sensitive.

### Step-by-step task procedures (tested CLI SOPs)

| Use this skill | For the task |
|---|---|
| **connecting-lambda-to-api-gateway** | Wire an existing Lambda to a new REST/HTTP API: proxy integration, permissions, CORS, throttling, access logging, deployment |
| **connecting-lambda-to-dynamodb** | Connect Lambda to DynamoDB: IAM execution role, read/write permissions, stream event source mapping |
| **creating-api-gateway-stage** | Create an API Gateway stage with CloudWatch logging, X-Ray tracing, throttling, WAF association, and authorization |
| **deploying-custom-domain-rest-api** | Deploy a Regional REST API with custom domain: ACM cert, Lambda backend, request authorizer, base path mapping, Route 53 DNS |
| **debugging-lambda-timeouts** | Systematically diagnose a timing-out Lambda: config, CloudWatch logs/metrics, VPC, cold starts, memory, downstream calls |
| **processing-s3-uploads-with-step-functions** | Deploy an event-driven workflow: S3 upload → EventBridge → Step Functions → Lambda (small files) or Fargate (large files), with VPC/ECR/ECS/IAM |
