# Querying metrics in CloudWatch Omni with PromQL

How metric querying works in CloudWatch Omni, and which metric answers which symptom
for each AWS service. Metrics in Omni are queried with **PromQL**, not SQL — the SQL
dialect in [sql-logs-traces.md](sql-logs-traces.md) reaches logs and traces only. This
file covers the decision between the two surfaces, what is and is not queryable, how to
discover metric names and labels, the PromQL conventions Omni adds (the `@`-labels and
the `__name__` matcher), a per-service catalog of the metrics that matter (unit, gauge
vs counter, identity label, derived formulas, dimension traps), and how to read an empty
result.

Treat every metric, label, and scope name in this file as vocabulary to recognise, not
schema to trust. Confirm the exact name against the account's own data (section 3)
before putting it in a query, a dashboard panel, or an alert rule.

## 1. Metrics are PromQL, not SQL

Omni has two query surfaces, and the shape of the ask decides which one you use:

| The ask is about | Surface | Looks like | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| A number over time — CPU, latency, request/error rate, queue depth, throttles, saturation, "how is X trending" | **PromQL** over metrics | An expression that does **not** start with `SELECT`, e.g. `histogram_avg({__name__="CPUUtilization", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})` | this file |
| Log lines, log fields, log counts by field | **SQL** over `logs.default` | `SELECT ... FROM logs.default WHERE \`@timestamp\` BETWEEN ...` | [sql-logs-traces.md](sql-logs-traces.md) |
| Spans, traces, span attributes, per-span durations | **SQL** over `traces.default` | `SELECT ... FROM traces.default WHERE ...` | [sql-logs-traces.md](sql-logs-traces.md) |

Rules that follow from this:

- **There is no `metrics.default` SQL table.** A metric request is answered with a raw
  PromQL expression, not `SELECT ... FROM metrics.default` — that table does not exist.
  The one place PromQL text legally appears *inside* SQL is the `promql('<data set>',
  '<expression>', <step-seconds>)` table function (section 4, "Time range binding";
  section 7) — never as a bare expression. That embedding is moot for metrics anyway:
  metric reads through the ad hoc `StartTelemetryQuery` path are disabled per account, so a
  metric read there fails either way: a bare PromQL expression is rejected by the
  SQL parser with `ValidationException: Invalid SQL`, while `SELECT ... FROM metrics.default`
  or a `promql()` wrapper parses but is rejected with `ValidationException: Metrics queries
  are not supported.` For an ad hoc metric read use a dashboard panel or an alert rule instead
  (section 4, section 7), where the language is set explicitly and the service runs the
  query. The raw PromQL construction pattern is still the answer to a "how do I query X"
  metric question (see the rule below) — you just deliver it as panel/alert PromQL, not as
  a string for the ad hoc query API.
- **Nothing SQL-specific applies to metrics.** `` `@record` ``, `` `@message` ``,
  `TABLESAMPLE`, `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE_FIELDS)`, and fine-grained access control (FGAC)
  are logs/traces features. Metrics do not apply FGAC.
- **No cross-surface JOIN.** There is no metric↔metric or metric↔logs/traces JOIN. To
  correlate a metric with logs or traces, run the PromQL query and the SQL query as
  **separate steps** and line them up on a shared time window and a shared identity
  (service name, function name, instance id).
- **Derive from spans only as a fallback.** A per-request latency percentile or error
  count can also be computed from `traces.default` (span `durationNano`, `status['code']`)
  in SQL. Prefer the metric when one exists — it is cheaper and pre-aggregated — and
  fall back to the span derivation only when no metric grounds the signal.

**Answer the construction question directly — do not stall or give up.** A metric-query
how-to ("how do I query / what PromQL shows X for `<service>`", "which metric tells me if
`<service>` is throttled/slow/erroring") is answered with the **PromQL construction pattern**,
even when a live probe returns no matching metric, or you have no Space in hand. When the
metric is not discoverable live, still give the query template — the `__name__` matcher, the
identity-label / `"@instrumentation.@name"` (or `"@resource.*"`) scope, and the correct
gauge-vs-counter read — and note to confirm the exact names against the account's own data
(section 3). **Never** substitute "no matching metrics found" or a clarifying question for the
query; the construction pattern is the answer.

### How this differs from CloudWatch metrics

CloudWatch (`aws cloudwatch get-metric-data`, metric math, Metrics Insights) and
Omni PromQL are different query models over different surfaces. Do not translate one into
the other mechanically:

| CloudWatch | Omni PromQL |
|---|---|
| Metric is addressed by **namespace** (`AWS/Lambda`) + name + dimensions | Metric is addressed by **name** (via `__name__`) + **labels**; the namespace becomes an instrumentation-scope label (`"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/lambda"`) |
| **Dimensions** (`FunctionName`) | The same names, as **labels** (`FunctionName="..."`) |
| **Statistic** chosen per query (`Sum`, `Average`, `p99`) | Aggregation is an **operator/function** (`sum`, `avg`, `rate`, `histogram_quantile`) and depends on whether the metric is a gauge, counter, or histogram |
| **Period** | **Range vector** (`[5m]`) plus the **step** of the evaluation (dashboards: `promqlQueryOptions.step`) |
| Metric math expressions (`m1/m2*100`) | Ordinary PromQL arithmetic between series with matching labels |
| Every vended metric is present | Only OTLP metrics, span-derived metrics, and **OTel-enriched** vended metrics are present (section 2) |

For publishing custom metrics, EMF, metric filters, and CloudWatch metric math, see
[../../cloudwatch/metrics.md](../../cloudwatch/metrics.md). If the account does not have Omni
enabled, or the metric is a CloudWatch-only vended metric, the CloudWatch route is the right
answer — not a forced PromQL query.

---

## 2. What is queryable — and what is not

Omni serves metrics from one OpenTelemetry-native, PromQL-queryable surface. It carries
resource and scope **attributes/labels** rather than a CloudWatch namespace.

| Family | What it is | Identity labels | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OTLP-ingested metrics** | Custom application metrics your services emit through an OTel SDK or collector, including Kubernetes workload metrics | `"@resource.service.name"`, `"@resource.k8s.*"` | `http_server_request_duration`, `k8s.pod.phase` |
| **Span-derived RED metrics** | Platform-generated from ingested traces — the rate/error/duration signals the service map and service dashboards use | `"@resource.service.name"`, `"@status.code"` | `traces.span.metrics.calls` (counter), `traces.span.metrics.duration` (native histogram) |
| **OTel-enriched vended AWS metrics** | Metrics AWS services publish natively (EC2, Lambda, RDS, ...) **after** OTel enrichment has projected them onto this surface | `"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/<service>"` + the original dimension as a bare label (`InstanceId`, `FunctionName`) | `{__name__="CPUUtilization", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"}` |

### Not queryable: CloudWatch vended metrics that are not enriched

Vended CloudWatch metrics that have **not** been OTel-enriched, and usage/billing-style
metrics such as `AWS/Logs` `IncomingBytes` / `IncomingLogEvents`, are **not yet supported
in CloudWatch Omni**. There is no CloudWatch execution path inside Omni (no `GetMetricData`
or Metrics Insights route behind the PromQL surface).

When the ask resolves to a CloudWatch-only metric:

- Say so plainly: *"CloudWatch metric queries are not yet supported in CloudWatch Omni
  (some vended metrics are not available)."* Do not force a PromQL query that can only
  return empty.
- Do not substitute a log-content scan for a metric. "How much are my log groups
  ingesting?" is a metric question (`IncomingBytes`), not a `logs.default` query.
- If the user only needs the number, offer the **CloudWatch** route as a
  separate, non-Omni step (`aws cloudwatch get-metric-data`; see
  [../../cloudwatch/metrics.md](../../cloudwatch/metrics.md)). If they want it in Omni, the
  fix is enrichment (below) — for resource types enrichment supports.

### OTel enrichment for vended AWS metrics

Vended AWS metrics are CloudWatch metrics by default. **OTel enrichment** ("vended metrics
in PromQL" in the AWS documentation) is the opt-in feature that also projects them onto
the PromQL surface:

- **Opt-in per account, per region.** Enable it in each region you need. The CloudWatch
  metric is unchanged and stays available through the CloudWatch APIs.
- **Ordered prerequisite.** First enable **resource tags on telemetry** for the account
  (`aws observabilityadmin start-telemetry-enrichment`, IAM action
  `observabilityadmin:StartTelemetryEnrichment`, which provisions the Resource Explorer
  indexing that enrichment relies on; check with `get-telemetry-enrichment-status`),
  **then** enable OTel enrichment (`aws cloudwatch start-otel-enrichment`, IAM action
  `cloudwatch:StartOTelEnrichment`; check with `get-otel-enrichment`, disable with
  `stop-otel-enrichment`). Both are public operations of their own services — CloudWatch
  Observability Admin and CloudWatch — not of `cloudwatch-omni`, and the CloudWatch API
  itself documents this order. An AWS CLI released before `start-otel-enrichment` will
  not have that subcommand; upgrade the CLI rather than look for it under another
  service.
- **Mapping is by metric name + dimensions → resource ARN**, not by tags. A supported
  resource does **not** need to be tagged to become PromQL-queryable; tags that are
  present are simply surfaced as `@aws.tag.*` labels.
- **Gated on a supported-resource list.** Only supported AWS resource types are
  enriched.
- **Names are preserved.** The metric keeps its CloudWatch name (`CPUUtilization`,
  `4xxErrors`), its dimensions become PromQL labels, and it gains an instrumentation
  scope label `"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/<service>"` (service segment
  lowercase).

So "why isn't my EC2 / Lambda metric in PromQL?" almost always means one of: enrichment
is not enabled for that account/region, resource-tags-on-telemetry was never enabled
first, or the resource type is not on the supported list.

## Service-health question — facts you MUST surface

A large share of real questions arrive as an operator symptom, not as a query: "is my
`<service>` throttled / slow / erroring / unhealthy," "which of my `<service>`s are
`<symptom>`," "what's the health of my `<service>`," "what signals / what should be on a
dashboard or view for `<service>`." These are **observability-data questions — answer
them from the telemetry surface, not from the resource's control plane.** Answering with
the *methodology* — the correct signals, aggregation, scoping, and caveats — is an
**output contract**: you owe the facts below **whether or not** you also pull live
numbers, and **even if** no matching resource exists in the account. Presenting real
metric values, or reporting "none found" and asking for a resource name, **without** these
facts is the single most common wrong answer here. Find the service's entry in the
per-service catalog (section 5) and surface every item that applies:

1. **Answer in PromQL, scoped.** Select each metric by name with the `__name__` matcher and
   scope it with `"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/<service>"` — or, for OTLP
   workloads (e.g. Kubernetes), the double-quoted `"@resource.*"` labels, which have **no**
   vended `@instrumentation` scope. Metrics are PromQL only — never SQL over `metrics.default`.
   The scoped selector is part of the answer even when the request names no product, the
   account has no Space in reach, or a `cloudwatch-omni` probe fails: write the selectors,
   then name the `AWS/<Service>` namespace as the CloudWatch-side equivalent for an account
   without enrichment. Do not replace the selectors with console statistic names.
2. **Gauge vs counter decides the read — universal, independent of the service.** Counters
   → `rate()` / `increase()`; gauges → `avg` / `max` / `min`. Never `rate()` a gauge; never
   average or read a raw counter value. On the enriched vended surface the *spelling* follows
   the instrument type (section 3): statistic-set metrics are delta exponential histograms,
   so max is `histogram_quantile(1, …)`, min `histogram_quantile(0, …)`, avg
   `histogram_avg(…)`, and a percentile `histogram_quantile(0.99, …)`; vended counts are
   delta Sums read with `sum_over_time(…[5m])`. On a histogram, `max()` and `min()` come back
   empty while `avg()` folds the buckets into one histogram instead of a number, and
   `rate()` / `increase()` over a delta Sum return a wrong (not an empty) number —
   confirm the instrument with the `__type__` / `__temporality__` labels.
3. **Group by the service's identity label** (`<identity-label>`, e.g. the resource-id/name
   dimension) so each series is attributed to a specific resource.
4. **Derived signals must be derived.** A ratio such as an error rate is
   `rate(<numerator>) / rate(<denominator>)` over the same window — there is no single
   vended "rate" metric. Never read a numerator alone without its denominator.
5. **Vended latency/duration metrics carry no `pNN` *label*, but a true percentile is still
   available** — they arrive as delta exponential histograms, so read the percentile with
   `histogram_quantile(0.99, {__name__="<metric>", …})` (section 3/4). Deriving percentiles
   from span histograms via SQL over `traces.default` remains an alternative.
6. **An empty series is often CORRECT, not a fault — universal.** A signal that exists only
   under a specific configuration (an opt-in feature, an installed agent, a burstable
   instance type, or a dimensionality the metric is not published at) returns nothing when
   that configuration is absent. Never claim an empty result proves the symptom is absent
   ("no datapoints ⇒ not throttled/slow/erroring").
7. **Confirm exact metric, dimension, and label names against the account's own data**
   (section 3) before relying on the query.
8. **Surface the service-specific traps from the catalog entry** (section 5) — units,
   opt-in-only metrics, dimension tiers, instance-type-only metrics, cold-start exclusions,
   binary 0/1 metrics that must be read with `max`. These are what make the answer correct;
   the universal rules above are necessary but not sufficient.

**Asking which signals or panels a `<service>` needs on a dashboard, view, or panel set is
this same question.** The dashboard, view, or panel wording does not turn it into a widget-mechanics
or layout request, and it is not a live-data request: do not probe for a Space first, and a
probe that fails or finds no Space does not change the content. Decide the panel set from
the catalog entry (section 5) and write the panels as the scoped PromQL selectors above,
**in the answer itself** — the `"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/<service>"` scope
and the identity label appear in the reply, not in a follow-up. Add the `AWS/<Service>`
namespace form in one line as the equivalent for an account without enrichment, and **do not
close by asking which product the customer is on**: the customer asked which signals belong
on the view, which is the same set either way, and the answer gives both spellings. Neither
dashboard file carries these facts: open
[../dashboards.md](../dashboards.md) (Omni body and grid) or the CloudWatch dashboards
reference only afterwards, and only if the customer wants it built. Do not enumerate the
fleet through the service's control plane (`ec2 describe-instances`, `ecs
describe-clusters`, `list-metrics`) to decide the content; a resource probe is for
grounding names once the panel set is agreed.

**Never** answer a service-health question by refusing / asking for a resource name first,
by presenting live numbers without the discipline above, by calling the service **control
plane** (`ecs describe-clusters`, `ec2 describe-instance-status`, `dynamodb describe-table`,
…), or by falling back to the CloudWatch-console / Prometheus mental model (no `pNN` label
on vended gauges; OTLP Kubernetes metrics are `k8s.*` with `"@resource.*"` labels, not
`pod_number_of_container_restarts` or `kube_*` selectors). A dependency / blast-radius
question ("what does `<service>` depend on / what's broken downstream") is answered from the
context graph, not here — use `GetContextGraph` (**never** X-Ray `GetServiceGraph`) per
[context-graph.md](../context-graph.md), whose "Dependency / blast-radius question — facts
you MUST surface" section carries that discipline. If the CLI/SDK errors with an unknown
`cloudwatch-omni` service, that is a client-version issue (upgrade botocore/AWS CLI), not a
reason to switch products.

---

## 3. Discovering metric names and labels

Metric names, label names, and scope spellings are **not guaranteed** — they depend on
what has been ingested and enriched in this account. A misspelled name does not error; it
returns an empty series. Discover before you write.

**Method 1 (not available for metrics): `ListTelemetryFields`.** The
`ListTelemetryFields` API enumerates the known fields of a data set for `LOGS` and
`TRACES` only — `METRICS` is not an accepted `telemetryType` in the current service
model (the value was removed), so there is no API call that lists metric names. Its
`fields` entries carry only `name` and `children`, so even for the telemetry types it
does cover it returns no instrument type (Sum / Gauge / Histogram) and no temporality
(delta / cumulative). For metrics, take names from the catalog below or from Method 2,
and read the instrument type and temporality off the `__type__` / `__temporality__`
labels a raw selector returns (Method 2) — the catalog names the *statistic* each metric
needs (max, min, avg, a rate); the instrument type decides how that statistic is spelled.

Once you know the instrument type, read the aggregation off it:

| Instrument type | Read it with |
|---|---|
| Gauge | `avg()` / `max()` / `min()` — never `rate()` |
| Sum, **cumulative** | `rate()` / `increase()` |
| Sum, **delta** (enriched vended counts such as `NetworkIn`, `ConsumedReadCapacityUnits` arrive this way) | `sum_over_time(<m>[5m])`, divided by the window seconds for a per-second value — `rate()` / `increase()` assume a cumulative counter, so on a delta Sum they return a **wrong (not an empty)** number |
| **ExponentialHistogram, delta** (enriched vended statistic-set metrics — `CPUUtilization`, `StatusCheckFailed*`, `CPUCreditBalance`, Lambda `Duration` — arrive this way, carrying CloudWatch's SampleCount/Sum/Min/Max) | max → `histogram_quantile(1, <m>)`, min → `histogram_quantile(0, <m>)`, avg → `histogram_avg(<m>)` (or `histogram_sum(<m>) / histogram_count(<m>)`), a true percentile → `histogram_quantile(0.99, <m>)`. A plain `max()` / `min()` yields **no series**; a plain `avg()` merges the buckets into one histogram, not a number. `histogram_quantile(1, …)` / `(0, …)` approximate the Max / Min via the top / bottom bucket bound (close to CloudWatch's Maximum / Minimum); `histogram_quantile(0.99, …)` is a real bucket-estimated percentile |
| Histogram (OTLP / span-derived, e.g. `traces.span.metrics.duration`) | `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(<base>[5m]))` on the **base** name — no `_bucket` suffix, no `by (le)` |

**Method 2: probe with a selector.** This is a *confirmatory* check, not a prerequisite —
per sections 1 and 2 you answer most metric questions from the catalog without any live
probe, and reach for this only when you already have a Space open and want to confirm a
name or its labels before committing it to a dashboard or alert. **There is no ad hoc
PromQL probe surface:** `StartTelemetryQuery` always parses its `queryString` as SQL and
metric reads through it are disabled per account (section 1; section 4, "Time range binding"),
so a selector cannot be run through the CLI/API ad hoc path. Run it as a scratch dashboard
panel query (`queryLanguage: "promql"`) or an alert-rule condition (`language: PROMQL`)
instead (section 7), then inspect the label set that comes back for a candidate name over
a short window:

```promql
{__name__="Invocations", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/lambda"}
```

The returned series show every label the metric actually carries (`FunctionName`,
`@aws.account`, `@aws.region`, any `@aws.tag.*`), which is what you group and filter by —
plus the instrument metadata labels `__type__` (`Gauge`, `Sum`, `ExponentialHistogram`),
`__temporality__` (`delta` / `cumulative`), `__monotonicity__`, and `__unit__`. Read those
first: they decide whether the statistic you want is spelled `max()`, `histogram_quantile(1,
…)`, `rate()`, or `sum_over_time()` (table above). A raw selector on a histogram-typed
metric returns the series with their labels but no plottable samples, which is the tell.
`__name__` must be an exact match — a regex matcher on `__name__` (`=~`) is rejected with
`Selector must have a metric name`; write one selector per metric name and combine with
`or` (plus `label_replace` to tag each side) when one panel needs several.

**Do not** use the SQL discovery tools for metrics — `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE_FIELDS)` and
`SELECT \`@record\`` are logs/traces-only.

Use the names discovery returns **exactly** — do not shorten, alias, pluralize, or
invent. Nouns in the request ("throttles", "5xx", "timeouts") describe what to aggregate,
not field names; map each to a real, grounded metric.

---

## 4. Query mechanics

### Label conventions

Labels on Omni's metrics surface follow an `@`-prefixed convention:

| Label form | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `"@resource.*"` | Resource attributes — the identity of an OTLP-native workload | `"@resource.service.name"`, `"@resource.k8s.namespace.name"`, `"@resource.k8s.deployment.name"`, `"@resource.k8s.pod.name"`, `"@resource.cloud.resource_id"` |
| `"@instrumentation.@name"` | Instrumentation scope — how an **enriched vended AWS metric** is scoped to its service (lowercase service segment). Replaces the CloudWatch `AWS/<Service>` namespace | `"cloudwatch.aws/ec2"`, `"cloudwatch.aws/lambda"`, `"cloudwatch.aws/rds"` |
| `"@aws.tag.*"` | Resource tags surfaced by enrichment | `"@aws.tag.Environment"` |
| `"@aws.*"` (without `tag`) | Reserved system labels | `"@aws.account"`, `"@aws.region"` |
| bare names | Datapoint attributes — the original CloudWatch dimensions of a vended metric | `InstanceId`, `FunctionName`, `TableName`, `QueueName` |

**Quoting rule:** any label name that is dotted or `@`-prefixed must be **double-quoted
inside the braces** — `{"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"}`. The same
applies inside `by (...)`: `sum by ("@resource.service.name") (...)`. Bare dimension
labels (`InstanceId`) are written unquoted as usual.

For OTLP / Kubernetes workloads and span RED metrics, the identity is **always** a
`"@resource.*"` label. Never use a generic Prometheus `job=` or bare `service=`
selector, and never the underscore `k8s_*` form — those are ungrounded and return
nothing.

### Selecting a metric: the `__name__` matcher

A PromQL metric name is really the reserved `__name__` label. A name that starts with a
digit or contains `%`, `.`, or spaces is **not** a legal bare identifier — common for
vended AWS metrics (`4xxErrors`, `4XXError`, `5XXError`, `4xxErrorRate`, `EBSIOBalance%`,
`Memory % Committed Bytes In Use`) and for every dotted OTel name
(`traces.span.metrics.calls`). Select those with a `__name__` matcher inside the braces:

```promql
{__name__="4xxErrors", FilterId="EntireBucket"}
{__name__="EBSIOBalance%", InstanceId="<instance-id>"}
{__name__="traces.span.metrics.calls", "@resource.service.name"="<service>"}
```

The value is an ordinary double-quoted string, so any character is legal there. A plain
identifier-safe name (`CPUUtilization`, `http_requests_total`) may be written bare
(`CPUUtilization{InstanceId="..."}`), but the `__name__` form always works — prefer it
for vended metrics so the scope and dimensions read uniformly:

```promql
{__name__="Errors", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/lambda", FunctionName="<fn>"}
{__name__="CPUUtilization", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2", InstanceId="<id>"}
```

**Never write the metric name as a bare token inside the braces** (a leading `"name",`
before the label matchers). That form does not parse on this surface. This applies
everywhere a metric is selected, including inside `rate(...)`, `sum(...)`, and
`histogram_quantile(...)`.

### Gauge, counter, histogram — the read decides the function

- **Gauge** — a level (CPU %, queue depth, free memory, connections, latency of a
  vended metric). Read with `avg` / `max` / `min`. **Never `rate()` a gauge.**
- **Counter (cumulative Sum)** — accumulates (requests, bytes, errors, invocations).
  Read with `rate()` (per-second) or `increase()` (total over the window). **Never read a
  raw counter value or average it.**
- **Delta Sum** — a per-interval count that does not accumulate. Read with
  `sum_over_time(<m>[w])` (divide by the window for a per-second value); `rate()` /
  `increase()` assume a cumulative counter and misread delta temporality, so they return a
  wrong — not an empty — number. Enriched vended count metrics (`NetworkIn`, `NetworkOut`,
  `ConsumedReadCapacityUnits`, …) are delta Sums.
- **Enriched vended statistic-set metric** — `CPUUtilization`, `StatusCheckFailed*`,
  `CPUCreditBalance`, Lambda `Duration` and the other "gauge"-shaped vended metrics reach
  this surface as **delta exponential histograms** that carry CloudWatch's statistic set.
  The catalog's gauge reads still name the right statistic, but spell them as
  `histogram_quantile(1, <m>)` for max, `histogram_quantile(0, <m>)` for min,
  `histogram_avg(<m>)` for avg (equivalently `histogram_sum(<m>) / histogram_count(<m>)`),
  and `histogram_quantile(0.99, <m>)` for a percentile — so a true pNN **is** available
  here, unlike what a "no percentile label" note might suggest. Reading it with a plain
  `max()` or `min()` yields nothing, and a plain `avg()` folds the buckets into one
  histogram rather than a single value. `histogram_quantile(1, …)` / `(0, …)` approximate the Max / Min via the
  top / bottom bucket bound (close to CloudWatch's Maximum / Minimum); intermediate
  quantiles are bucket-estimated.
- **Histogram** — `traces.span.metrics.duration` is a native exponential histogram. Read
  percentiles with `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate({__name__="traces.span.metrics.duration", ...}[5m]))`
  on the **base** metric name — no `_bucket` suffix, no `by (le)`.
- **Already-per-second gauges** (RDS `ReadIOPS`, `ReadThroughput`) must **not** be
  wrapped in `rate()` — that double-rates into nonsense.

Applying `rate()` to a gauge, or averaging a per-period counter, is the most common way
to produce a confident-but-meaningless number. When unsure, check the instrument type
via discovery (section 3).

### Time range binding

Where the query runs decides how time is expressed:

| Context | Time handling |
|---|---|
| **Interactive / ad hoc query** | `StartTelemetryQuery` takes only `queryString` and a `sessionId` (from `StartTelemetryQuerySession`); results come back through `GetTelemetryQueryResults`. There is no language or time-range parameter because the query string is always parsed as SQL — a bare PromQL expression fails with `ValidationException`. PromQL reaches this path only embedded as the table function `promql('<data set>', '<expression>', <step-seconds>)` inside a SQL statement, and the evaluation window is that relation's mandatory `WHERE \`@timestamp\` BETWEEN ... AND ...` predicate. Metrics through `StartTelemetryQuery` are disabled per account at GA (`ValidationException: Metrics queries are not supported.`, section 1), so for an ad hoc metric read use a dashboard panel or an alert rule, where the language is explicit and the service does the wrapping. |
| **Dashboard panel** ([../dashboards.md](../dashboards.md)) | Keep the expression **windowless** — the panel/dashboard `scope` drives the range. Set `queryLanguage: "promql"` explicitly and match `promqlQueryOptions.step` (seconds) to the range vector — a `[5m]` window at the default 60 s step over-samples 5x; set `step: 300`. |
| **Alert rule** ([../alerts.md](../alerts.md)) | The alert has no window of its own — the expression **must** carry its own range selector (`[5m]`). Do **not** bake the threshold comparison into the expression; the threshold is a separate field on the condition. Set `language: PROMQL`. |

### Common functions

| Need | Expression shape |
|---|---|
| Per-second rate of a counter | `rate(<selector>[5m])` |
| Total increase over a window | `increase(<selector>[1h])` |
| Aggregate across series | `sum(...)`, `avg(...)`, `max(...)`, `min(...)`, `count(...)` |
| Group by an identity | `sum by (FunctionName) (rate(...))`, `avg by ("@resource.service.name") (...)` |
| Top N | `topk(10, sum by (...) (rate(...)))` |
| Ratio / derived metric | `rate(<errors>[5m]) / rate(<total>[5m])` for cumulative counters; for enriched vended delta Sums (e.g. Lambda / S3 error rates) use `sum_over_time(<errors>[5m]) / sum_over_time(<total>[5m])` — a same-window `rate()/rate()` on delta Sums can read an impossible ratio. Labels must match on both sides; add `on (...)` / `ignoring (...)` when they do not |
| Percentile from a native histogram | `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(<base>[5m]))` |
| Smooth a gauge | `avg_over_time(<gauge>[15m])`, `max_over_time(<gauge>[15m])` |

Worked examples:

```promql
# Lambda error rate per function (enriched vended delta Sums -> sum_over_time totals, then divide)
sum by (FunctionName) (sum_over_time({__name__="Errors", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/lambda"}[5m]))
  /
sum by (FunctionName) (sum_over_time({__name__="Invocations", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/lambda"}[5m]))

# Request rate per service from span RED metrics
sum by ("@resource.service.name") (rate({__name__="traces.span.metrics.calls"}[5m]))

# p99 latency per service from the native histogram
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by ("@resource.service.name") (rate({__name__="traces.span.metrics.duration"}[5m])))

# Pods per deployment in a namespace (gauge -> count as-is)
count by ("@resource.k8s.deployment.name") ({__name__="k8s.pod.phase", "@resource.k8s.namespace.name"="<ns>"})

# S3 request error ratio (digit-leading names -> __name__)
sum_over_time({__name__="4xxErrors", FilterId="EntireBucket"}[5m]) / sum_over_time({__name__="AllRequests", FilterId="EntireBucket"}[5m])
```

## 5. Per-service metric catalog

Each section names the CloudWatch namespace (for recognition only — the CloudWatch surface is
not queryable here) and the **identity label** to filter and group by. On the PromQL
surface an enriched vended metric is reached via
`"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/<service>"` (lowercase) plus the identity
label. Confirm the exact scope and label spelling against discovery.

Two universal rules:

- **Gauge vs counter decides the read** (section 4).
- **On the enriched vended surface, spell the read by the OTLP instrument type, not the
  CloudWatch shape.** No enriched vended metric is a raw gauge or a cumulative counter:
  every one arrives with **delta** temporality as either a **Sum** (counts — `NetworkIn`,
  `Invocations`, request/error counts) or an **ExponentialHistogram** (levels, latency,
  utilization — `CPUUtilization`, `Duration`, `TargetResponseTime`, `*Latency`). The `Type`
  and `Read as` columns below name the CloudWatch-side shape and the statistic you want;
  spell that statistic per section 3/4 — histogram: max `histogram_quantile(1, …)`, min
  `histogram_quantile(0, …)`, avg `histogram_avg(…)`, percentile `histogram_quantile(0.99, …)`;
  delta Sum: a windowed total with `sum_over_time(…[5m])`, used on both sides of a ratio. So
  a "gauge … avg/max" row for a vended latency metric is read with `histogram_avg` /
  `histogram_quantile`, and a true percentile **is** available even where a row says "no
  percentile label". A plain `max()` / `min()` empties on a histogram; `rate()` / `increase()`
  misread a delta Sum and can return an impossible value on a short window, so derive a rate
  as a `sum_over_time` ratio. This is spelling only where the surface is enriched — the same
  metric read through the CloudWatch APIs (non-enriched) keeps its classic gauge/counter
  statistics.
- **An empty series is often correct, not a bug.** A signal that exists only under a
  specific configuration (an agent installed, a burstable instance type, a
  request-metrics filter, an export enabled) returns nothing when that condition is
  absent. Read "no data" as "not configured / not applicable here" before treating it as
  an outage.

Signal taxonomies:

- **Request-serving services** (ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront, S3 request metrics,
  Application Signals) → **RED**: Rate, Errors, Duration.
- **Resources / infrastructure** (EC2, EBS, RDS, ECS, Lambda concurrency) → **USE /
  saturation**: Utilization, Saturation, Errors, plus headroom signals (credit balances,
  free storage, free memory, queue depth) that trend toward a limit.
- **Flow / queue services** (SQS, SNS) → throughput (counters) vs backlog and age
  (gauges).

### EC2 — `AWS/EC2` (+ `CWAgent`), identity `InstanceId`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CPUUtilization` | gauge (delta exp. histogram when enriched) | Percent | `avg` / `max` — spelled `histogram_avg(…)` / `histogram_quantile(1, …)`; never `rate()` |
| `CPUCreditBalance` | gauge (delta exp. histogram) | Credits | `min` — `histogram_quantile(0, …)`; burstable (T-family) only |
| `NetworkIn` / `NetworkOut` / `NetworkPacketsIn` / `NetworkPacketsOut` | counter (delta Sum when enriched) | Bytes / Count | `sum_over_time(…[5m])` (÷ 300 for per-second); `rate()` / `increase()` misread the delta Sum and return a wrong number |
| `DiskReadBytes` / `DiskWriteBytes` / `DiskReadOps` / `DiskWriteOps` | counter (delta Sum) | Bytes / Count | `sum_over_time(…[5m])` — **instance-store only**, not EBS |
| `StatusCheckFailed` / `_Instance` / `_System` / `_AttachedEBS` | binary per-period (delta exp. histogram) | 0/1 | `max` — `histogram_quantile(1, …)`; a `1` means it failed in the period; averaging hides it |
| `InstanceEBSIOPSExceededCheck` / `InstanceEBSThroughputExceededCheck` | binary | 0/1 | `max` (Nitro) |
| `EBSIOBalance%` / `EBSByteBalance%` | gauge | Percent | `min` — `__name__` form |
| `mem_used_percent`, `disk_used_percent` (CWAgent) | gauge | Percent | `avg` — **only if the CloudWatch agent is installed**; if enriched as a histogram, `histogram_sum/histogram_count` |

- `CPUCreditBalance` is read with `min` and exists only on burstable (T-family)
  instances — an empty series on other types is correct, not a fault. On a burstable
  instance a balance near 0 while CPU sits at the baseline is **throttling**: the
  hypervisor is capping the instance, so a flat "healthy-looking" CPU chart is the
  symptom, not reassurance. Say so whenever a credit panel is on a health view.
- Memory and disk-**space** metrics exist only in `CWAgent`; an empty guest-OS chart
  usually means "no agent," not "no data" — the hypervisor cannot see guest RAM. Memory
  utilization is **not** available by default from `AWS/EC2`.
- `StatusCheckFailed*` is a per-period 0/1 flag, not a level: read it with `max` — spelled
  `histogram_quantile(1, …)` on the enriched surface — because an average over a window
  that contained one failed check rounds the failure away.
- The family is four metrics, and each points at a different owner — say which when you
  chart them: `StatusCheckFailed` (either check failed), `StatusCheckFailed_System` (the
  AWS host hardware or network underneath the instance — nothing to fix in the guest;
  stop/start moves it to a healthy host), `StatusCheckFailed_Instance` (the customer's
  own OS, boot, or network configuration inside the instance), and
  `StatusCheckFailed_AttachedEBS` (an attached volume is unreachable). A panel that shows
  the parent alone cannot tell the operator which side to look at.
- `DiskRead*` / `DiskWrite*` count **instance-store** I/O only. The EBS side of an
  instance's I/O is the `AWS/EBS` family keyed by `VolumeId` (next entry), not an `AWS/EC2`
  metric.
- **A health dashboard for a group of EC2 instances is built from this table**, and the
  answer is the selectors themselves — written into the reply, not offered after the
  customer picks a product, and not replaced by CloudWatch console statistic names. Every
  selector carries the `"@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"` scope and groups by
  `InstanceId`; state that scope in the answer and write the selectors out:

  ```promql
  # S = "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"; every result already carries InstanceId
  histogram_quantile(1, {__name__="CPUUtilization", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})              # max CPU per instance
  histogram_avg({__name__="CPUUtilization", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})                     # avg CPU per instance
  histogram_quantile(1, {__name__="StatusCheckFailed_System", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})   # 0/1 per instance
  histogram_quantile(1, {__name__="StatusCheckFailed_Instance", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})
  histogram_quantile(1, {__name__="StatusCheckFailed_AttachedEBS", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})
  histogram_quantile(0, {__name__="CPUCreditBalance", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})           # min credits; burstable only
  sum by (InstanceId) (sum_over_time({__name__="NetworkIn", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"}[5m])) # bytes per 5m; / 300 for B/s
  avg by (InstanceId) ({__name__="mem_used_percent", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/ec2"})   # CloudWatch agent only; a gauge — check __type__ first
  ```

  These are the spellings that return usable series on an enriched Space: `max by (InstanceId) (...)`
  returns nothing on the histogram metrics, and `rate(...NetworkIn...)` misreads the delta Sum and
  returns a wrong number rather than the per-5m total (section 3). `__name__` takes
  no regex — one selector per check type, combined with `or` when one panel needs all three.
  The same names exist under the `AWS/EC2` / `CWAgent` namespaces on the CloudWatch side
  for an account without enrichment; mention that as the fallback, not as the answer. The
  Omni dashboard body for this set is the EC2 fleet archetype in
  [../dashboards.md](../dashboards.md).
- Correlate with: EBS (volume side of the same I/O), ALB (instances as targets), RDS
  (app tier driving the DB).

### EBS — `AWS/EBS`, identity `VolumeId`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VolumeReadOps` / `VolumeWriteOps` / `VolumeReadBytes` / `VolumeWriteBytes` | counter | Count / Bytes | `rate()` |
| `VolumeTotalReadTime` / `VolumeTotalWriteTime` | counter | Seconds | derived latency only (Xen-era) |
| `VolumeAvgReadLatency` / `VolumeAvgWriteLatency` | gauge | ms | `avg` / `max` (Nitro — prefer these) |
| `VolumeAvgIOPS` / `VolumeAvgThroughput` | gauge | ops/s / KiB/s | `avg` (Nitro) |
| `VolumeIOPSExceededCheck` / `VolumeThroughputExceededCheck` / `VolumeStalledIOCheck` | binary | 0/1 | `max` |
| `VolumeQueueLength` | gauge | Count | `avg` / `max` — a count, not a duration |
| `BurstBalance` | gauge | Percent | `min` — gp2/st1/sc1 only |

- **Xen-era latency is derived:** per-op read latency ≈
  `rate(VolumeTotalReadTime[5m]) / rate(VolumeReadOps[5m])` (x1000 for ms) — an average
  only, never a percentile. On Nitro, `VolumeTotalReadTime` is documented as not
  relevant; use the `VolumeAvg*` gauges.
- `BurstBalance` is empty on gp3/io1/io2 (correct).
- Correlate with: EC2 (instance side), RDS (its storage behaves like an EBS volume — a
  write-latency spike with healthy CPU points at storage).

### Lambda — `AWS/Lambda`, identity `FunctionName`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Invocations` / `Errors` / `Throttles` | counter (delta Sum when enriched) | Count | `sum_over_time(…[5m])` for a windowed total; error rate is a `sum_over_time` ratio (`rate()`/`increase()` misread the delta Sum) |
| `Duration` | gauge (delta exp. histogram when enriched) | ms | `histogram_avg(…)` for avg, `histogram_quantile(1, …)` for max, `histogram_quantile(0.99, …)` for a true p99 |
| `ConcurrentExecutions` | gauge | Count | `max` |
| `ProvisionedConcurrencyUtilization` / `ClaimedAccountConcurrency` | gauge | ratio 0–1 (e.g. `0.7`, not a percent) / Count | `max` (saturation) |
| `UnreservedConcurrentExecutions` | gauge | Count | account/region-level — **no `FunctionName`** |
| `AsyncEventsReceived` / `AsyncEventsDropped` | counter | Count | `rate()` |
| `AsyncEventAge` | gauge | ms | `max` (async backlog) |
| `IteratorAge` | gauge | ms | `max` — Kinesis / DynamoDB Streams consumer lag |
| `OffsetLag` | gauge | Count | `max` — Kafka / MSK consumer lag |

- **Error rate is derived:** `sum_over_time(Errors[5m]) / sum_over_time(Invocations[5m])`
  (section 4 example) — `Errors` and `Invocations` are enriched delta Sums, so a
  `rate()/rate()` ratio can read a wrong (even impossible) value on a short window; the
  windowed-total ratio is stable. Do not read `Errors` alone without the denominator.
- Grouping `UnreservedConcurrentExecutions` by function returns nothing (correct).
- Cold starts are **not** a metric (`Duration` excludes cold-start time) — cold-start and
  error detail live in the function log group `/aws/lambda/<function>`, a SQL log query.
- A true pNN for `Duration` **is** available on the enriched surface — it arrives as a
  delta exponential histogram (section 3/4), so
  `histogram_quantile(0.99, {__name__="Duration", "@instrumentation.@name"="cloudwatch.aws/lambda", FunctionName="<fn>"})`
  returns a real p99. Deriving the percentile from spans over `traces.default` in SQL stays
  a valid alternative when the function's metric is not enriched.
- Correlate with: API Gateway / ALB (invokers), SQS / DynamoDB (event sources).

### DynamoDB — `AWS/DynamoDB`, identity `TableName`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Dimensions | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SuccessfulRequestLatency` | gauge | ms | `TableName`, `Operation` | `avg` / `max` — group by **both** or GetItem/Query/Scan blend |
| `ThrottledRequests` | counter | Count | `TableName`, `Operation` | `rate()` |
| `ConsumedReadCapacityUnits` / `ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits` | counter (delta Sum when enriched) | Units | `TableName`, `GlobalSecondaryIndexName` (writes add `Source`) | `sum_over_time(…[5m])` (÷ window for per-second) — **no `Operation`** |
| `ReadThrottleEvents` / `WriteThrottleEvents` | counter | Count | `TableName`, `GlobalSecondaryIndexName` | `rate()` |
| `SystemErrors` | counter | Count | `TableName`, `Operation` | `rate()` — **not published on `TableName` alone** |
| `UserErrors` | counter | Count | account/region-level | `rate()` |
| `ConditionalCheckFailedRequests` / `TransactionConflict` | counter | Count | `TableName` | `rate()` (secondary) |

- A `SystemErrors` alert scoped to `TableName` only never has data — include
  `Operation`.
- Compare consumed against provisioned capacity for saturation.
- Correlate with: Lambda (pair throttles with function errors), Application Signals.

### ECS — `AWS/ECS` and `ECS/ContainerInsights`, identity `ClusterName` (+ `ServiceName`)

| Metric | Type | Unit | Tier | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CPUUtilization` / `MemoryUtilization` | gauge | Percent | cluster or service | `avg` / `max` |
| `EBSFilesystemUtilization` | gauge | Percent | service (with an EBS volume) | `max` |
| `CPUReservation` / `MemoryReservation` / `GPUReservation` | gauge | Percent | **cluster, `AWS/ECS`, EC2 launch type only** | `avg` |
| `RunningTaskCount` / `PendingTaskCount` / `DesiredTaskCount` | gauge | Count | Container Insights (opt-in) | `max` / `min` |

- **Split the tiers by dimension:** service-tier series carry `ClusterName` **and** a
  non-empty `ServiceName`; cluster-tier series carry `ClusterName` only. Filtering the
  wrong one blends or empties the series.
- Fargate emits no reservation metrics; `GPUReservation` also needs GPU instances (both
  correct-empty). Reservations are not under Container Insights.
- Correlate with: ALB (in front), EC2 (container instances for EC2 launch type).

### RDS — `AWS/RDS`, identity `DBInstanceIdentifier`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CPUUtilization` | gauge | Percent | `avg` / `max` |
| `DatabaseConnections` | gauge | Count | `avg` / `max` — never `rate()` |
| `ReadIOPS` / `WriteIOPS` | gauge (already per-second) | Count/s | `avg` — **do not `rate()`** |
| `ReadThroughput` / `WriteThroughput` | gauge (already per-second) | Bytes/s | `avg` — **do not `rate()`** |
| `ReadLatency` / `WriteLatency` | gauge | **Seconds** | `avg` / `max` (x1000 for ms) — raw, not derived |
| `DiskQueueDepth` | gauge | Count | `max` (storage saturation) |
| `FreeableMemory` / `FreeStorageSpace` | gauge | Bytes | `min` — **free**, so alert *below* a threshold |
| `ReplicaLag` | gauge | Seconds | `max` |
| `BurstBalance`, `EBSIOBalance%`, `EBSByteBalance%` | gauge | Percent | `min` — burstable storage only; `__name__` form for `%` |
| `ServerlessDatabaseCapacity` | gauge | ACUs | `avg` — Aurora Serverless only |

- Best chart: `CPUUtilization` overlaid with `DatabaseConnections`. CPU tracking
  connections is an app problem; CPU high at flat connections is a query/plan problem.
- RDS has no `*TotalTime` metrics — latency is raw, unlike EBS.
- Logs require export: `/aws/rds/instance/<id>/<logType>` (error / slowquery / audit /
  general / postgresql); the error log is free-form.
- Correlate with: EBS (storage layer), EC2 (app tier).

### Application Load Balancer — `AWS/ApplicationELB`, identity `LoadBalancer`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RequestCount` / `ActiveConnectionCount` | counter | Count | `rate()` |
| `HTTPCode_Target_2XX_Count` / `_3XX_` / `_4XX_` / `_5XX_Count` | counter | Count | `rate()` — target-generated |
| `HTTPCode_ELB_3XX_Count` / `_4XX_` / `_5XX_Count` (+ `_500_` / `_502_` / `_503_` / `_504_Count`) | counter | Count | `rate()` — **LB-generated, a different family** |
| `TargetResponseTime` | gauge (delta exp. histogram when enriched) | **Seconds** | `avg` / `max` (x1000 for ms) — `histogram_avg` / `histogram_quantile` on the enriched surface; p99 via `histogram_quantile(0.99, …)` |
| `HealthyHostCount` / `UnHealthyHostCount` | gauge | Count | `min` / `max` — per `TargetGroup` only |
| `RejectedConnectionCount` / `TargetConnectionErrorCount` / `TargetTLSNegotiationErrorCount` | counter | Count | `rate()` (saturation / connection errors) |
| `LambdaUserError` / `LambdaInternalError` | counter | Count | `rate()` (Lambda targets) |

- The names carry a **`_Count` suffix** — `HTTPCode_Target_5XX` alone returns nothing.
- An ELB-5xx spike with flat target-5xx points at the LB / health-check path (e.g. no
  healthy target), not the app.
- The `LoadBalancer` label value is the `app/<name>/<hash>` segment, not the full ARN.
  ALB (`AWS/ApplicationELB`) ≠ NLB (`AWS/NetworkELB`) ≠ CloudWatch (`AWS/ELB`).
- Fractional host counts are normal from flapping.
- Correlate with: EC2 (instance targets), Lambda (Lambda targets).

### SQS — `AWS/SQS`, identity `QueueName`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` | gauge | Seconds | `max` — **the best signal** |
| `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` | gauge | Count | `max` (backlog) |
| `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible` | gauge | Count | `max` (in flight — **not** backlog) |
| `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed` | gauge | Count | `max` (delay timer) |
| `NumberOfMessagesSent` / `Received` / `Deleted` | counter | Count | `sum(rate(...))` — not the average |

- A low-depth queue with high oldest-age is a poison pill or stalled consumer.
- Total enqueued ≈ Visible + NotVisible + Delayed.
- FIFO queues share the same metrics. A dead-letter queue is just another `QueueName` —
  rising Visible on a DLQ means the source queue is failing processing.
- Correlate with: SNS (fan-out source), Lambda (event-source-mapping consumer — pair
  age/backlog with function `Errors` / `Throttles` / `Duration`).

### SNS — `AWS/SNS`, identity `TopicName`

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NumberOfMessagesPublished` / `NumberOfNotificationsDelivered` / `NumberOfNotificationsFailed` | counter | Count | `rate()` |
| `NumberOfNotificationsFilteredOut` (+ `-MessageAttributes` / `-MessageBody` / `-InvalidAttributes`) | counter | Count | `rate()` — "why didn't my subscriber get it" |
| `NumberOfNotificationsRedrivenToDlq` / `NumberOfNotificationsFailedToRedriveToDlq` | counter | Count | `rate()` |
| `PublishSize` | gauge | Bytes | `avg` |
| `SMSSuccessRate` | gauge | Fraction | `avg` — a `sum` is meaningless |
| `SMSMonthToDateSpentUSD` | cumulative, resets monthly | USD | `max` within the month — never `rate()` |

- `NumberOfNotificationsFailed` is a **delivery** failure — a failed Publish call surfaces
  in API 4xx/5xx, not here.
- **Do not compute delivered / published as a success rate**: one publish fans out to N
  subscribers, so delivered normally exceeds published.
- Correlate with: SQS (subscriber queue depth / DLQ), Lambda (subscribed functions).

### S3 — `AWS/S3`, identity `BucketName` (two families)

| Family | Metric | Type | Unit | Required label | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Storage (daily, free) | `BucketSizeBytes` | gauge | Bytes | `StorageType` (e.g. `StandardStorage`) | `max` over a multi-day window |
| Storage (daily, free) | `NumberOfObjects` | gauge | Count | `StorageType="AllStorageTypes"` | `max` over a multi-day window |
| Request (1-minute, opt-in, billed) | `AllRequests`, `GetRequests`, `PutRequests`, ... | counter (delta Sum when enriched) | Count | `FilterId` (commonly `EntireBucket`) | `sum_over_time(…[5m])` for a windowed total |
| Request | `4xxErrors` / `5xxErrors` | counter (delta Sum when enriched) | Count | `FilterId` | error rate is a `sum_over_time` ratio (see section 4); `__name__` form |
| Request | `FirstByteLatency` / `TotalRequestLatency` | gauge | ms | `FilterId` | `avg` / `max` |

- Storage metrics look flat or broken at short ranges because emission is daily.
  Omitting `StorageType` returns multiple or no series.
- Request metrics exist only where a request-metrics filter is configured; omitting
  `FilterId` double-counts. An empty request overview is a config gap, not a bug.
- Error ratio: see the S3 example in section 4.
- Correlate with: CloudFront (most public reads hit the CDN and never reach S3 request
  metrics), ALB (same RED grammar).

### API Gateway — `AWS/ApiGateway`, identity varies by flavour

| Flavour | Identity | RED metrics | Error metrics |
|---|---|---|---|
| REST (v1) | `ApiName` (+ `Stage`, `Resource`, `Method`) | `Count` (counter), `Latency`, `IntegrationLatency` (gauges, ms) | `4XXError` / `5XXError` (counters, `__name__` form) |
| HTTP (v2) | `ApiId` (+ `Stage`, `Route`) | `Count`, `Latency`, `IntegrationLatency`, `DataProcessed` | `4xx` / `5xx` (counters, `__name__` form) |
| WebSocket (v2) | `ApiId` (+ `Stage`, `Route`) | `ConnectCount`, `MessageCount`, `IntegrationLatency` | `IntegrationError`, `ClientError`, `ExecutionError` |

- Using the wrong identity label (`ApiName` vs `ApiId`) returns an empty series.
  WebSocket APIs do **not** emit `4xx` / `5xx` / `Count` / `Latency`.
- Derived: gateway overhead = `Latency - IntegrationLatency`. High `Latency` with flat
  `IntegrationLatency` implicates the gateway/config; the reverse implicates the backend.
- `CacheHitCount` / `CacheMissCount` are empty unless caching is enabled (correct).
  Method/route-level metrics need "detailed metrics" enabled. Access/execution logs are
  opt-in with no fixed group name.
- Correlate with: Lambda (pair `IntegrationLatency` with `Duration`), Application
  Signals.

### CloudFront — `AWS/CloudFront`, identity `DistributionId` (+ fixed `Region="Global"`)

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Requests` | counter | Count | `rate()` for req/s, `increase()` for a daily total |
| `BytesDownloaded` / `BytesUploaded` | counter | Bytes | `rate()` |
| `TotalErrorRate` / `4xxErrorRate` / `5xxErrorRate` | gauge | Percent | `avg` — **never `rate()`, never divide by `Requests`** (already a percentage); `__name__` form |

- 4xx (client / cache-miss 403/404) vs 5xx (origin-fetch) split the headline error rate.
- Metrics live only in `us-east-1` under `Region="Global"` regardless of edge location —
  query us-east-1; never emit another region matcher for CloudFront.
- Cache-hit-rate and per-edge metrics are opt-in (paid). Access logs go to S3 or a
  stream, not CloudWatch Logs.
- Correlate with: S3 (pair `5xxErrorRate` with S3 `5xxErrors`), ALB origin (target 5xx).

### Application Signals — `AWS/ApplicationSignals`, identity `Service` (SLOs: `SloName`)

| Metric | Type | Unit | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Latency` | gauge | ms | `avg` / `max` |
| `Fault` | counter | Count | `rate()` — HTTP 5xx + OTel span-status errors |
| `Error` | counter | Count | `rate()` — HTTP 4xx client errors (excluding intentional, e.g. 429) |
| `TotalRequestCountPerMinute` / `BadRequestCountPerMinute` | counter | Count | `rate()` (request-based SLOs; observability only) |
| `AttainmentRate` / `BreachedCount` | gauge / counter | Percent / Count | `min` / `rate()` — dimensioned by **`SloName`** |

- The names are **`Fault` / `Error`**, not `FaultCount` / `ErrorCount`. Service
  dimensions are `Service`, `Operation`, `Environment`; dependency metrics add
  `RemoteService` / `RemoteOperation`.
- **Availability** = `(1 - Fault / Total) x 100`, where Total is the request count
  (classically `SampleCount(Latency)`).
- This is the entry point for "how is `<service>` doing?" when the entity is an
  Application Signals service or SLO — it aggregates across the infrastructure services
  above.
- Correlate with: the infrastructure behind the span (EC2/ECS/Lambda), and the traces
  themselves for the offending span path.

### Kubernetes / EKS (OTLP) — identity `"@resource.service.name"` (RED), `"@resource.k8s.*"` (USE)

OTLP-ingested Kubernetes workloads have no CloudWatch namespace and no vended-AWS
instrumentation scope. Group and filter by the double-quoted `"@resource.*"` labels.

| Signal | Metric | Type | Read as |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request / error rate | `traces.span.metrics.calls` | counter | `sum by ("@resource.service.name") (rate(...[5m]))`; split errors by `"@status.code"` |
| Latency p50/p90/p99 | `traces.span.metrics.duration` | native histogram | `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(...[5m]))` on the base name |
| Container / pod CPU and memory vs requests/limits | OTLP `k8s.*` / `container.*` resource metrics | gauge | `avg` / `max`, grouped by `"@resource.k8s.namespace.name"` → `"@resource.k8s.deployment.name"` → `"@resource.k8s.pod.name"` (broadest to narrowest) |
| Restarts, pod phase | `k8s.container.restarts`, `k8s.pod.phase` | counter / gauge | `increase()` / `count by (...)` |

- This is the same span-derived layer the service map uses.
- An empty series usually means the workload is not exporting that OTLP metric (no
  collector/exporter for it), not that usage is zero.
- Correlate with: Application Signals (application-scoped RED of the same spans), node /
  EC2 metrics for host-level saturation.

## 6. Reading results

### Empty series: expected vs real

Before treating "no data" as an outage, check whether the metric can exist here:

| Empty series on | Usually means |
|---|---|
| Any vended AWS metric (`CPUUtilization`, `Invocations`, ...) | OTel enrichment is not enabled for this account/region, resource-tags-on-telemetry was not enabled first, or the resource type is not supported (section 2) |
| A metric selected with a bare dotted/digit-leading name | Parse problem — use the `__name__` form (section 4) |
| A vended metric with the wrong identity label (`ApiName` vs `ApiId`, `HTTPCode_Target_5XX` without `_Count`) | Wrong label or name — re-check discovery |
| `CPUCreditBalance`, `BurstBalance`, `EBSIOBalance%` | Non-burstable instance / volume type — correct |
| `CWAgent` memory / disk-space metrics | CloudWatch agent not installed — correct |
| S3 request metrics | No request-metrics filter configured — correct |
| S3 storage metrics at a short range | Daily emission — widen to multiple days |
| ECS reservations | Fargate, or a service-tier filter on a cluster-tier metric |
| `UnreservedConcurrentExecutions` grouped by function; `SystemErrors` on `TableName` alone | Metric is not published at that dimensionality |
| Any enriched vended metric read with a bare `max()` / `min()` while the bare selector shows series | It is a delta ExponentialHistogram — spell it `histogram_quantile(1, …)` / `(0, …)` / `histogram_avg(…)` (section 3). A bare `avg()` does **not** empty (it hands back one merged-bucket series); `rate()` over a delta Sum returns a wrong, not empty, number |
| CloudFront outside `us-east-1` / with a region matcher | Metrics exist only under `Region="Global"` in us-east-1 |
| API Gateway `4xx` / `Count` / `Latency` on a WebSocket API | WebSocket emits a different set |
| Any OTLP / Kubernetes metric | Not exported by the workload's collector |
| Any `"@resource.*"` grouping | Used `job=` / `service=` / `k8s_*` instead of the `"@resource.*"` form |

An empty result is **not** a reason to fabricate a number or switch to a log scan; it is
a reason to re-ground the name (section 3) or explain the missing configuration.

### Common errors and their causes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ValidationException: Metrics queries are not supported.` | A SQL query aimed at metrics — there is no `metrics.default` table | Write PromQL; set the language to PromQL |
| "CloudWatch metric queries are not yet supported in CloudWatch Omni (some vended metrics are not available)." | The metric is a non-enriched vended or usage metric | Enable enrichment (if supported), or use CloudWatch outside Omni |
| Parse error on a selector | Metric name written as a bare token inside the braces, or a dotted / `@` label left unquoted | `{__name__="<name>", "@label"="..."}` |
| `Selector must have a metric name. Found matchers: [__name__, ...]` (400) | `__name__` written as a regex matcher (`=~`) | One selector per exact metric name; combine with `or` + `label_replace` |
| `max()` / `min()` over an enriched vended metric returns no series (a bare `avg()` instead hands back one merged-bucket series, not a number), but the raw selector lists the instances | The metric is a delta ExponentialHistogram (`__type__`) | `histogram_quantile(1, …)` / `histogram_quantile(0, …)` / `histogram_avg(…)` |
| `rate()` / `increase()` over an enriched vended count returns an impossibly small or wrong number | The metric is a delta Sum (`__temporality__="delta"`); `rate()` / `increase()` assume a cumulative counter | `sum_over_time(…[5m])` (÷ window for per-second) |
| A rate that is impossibly small or noisy | `rate()` applied to a gauge, or to an already-per-second gauge (RDS IOPS/throughput) | Read gauges with `avg` / `max` |
| A "count" that never grows / averages to nonsense | `avg()` on a counter | `rate()` / `increase()` for a cumulative counter; `sum_over_time(…[5m])` for an enriched vended delta Sum |
| A percentile that disagrees with the console | Read a vended latency histogram (`Duration`, `TargetResponseTime`, `SuccessfulRequestLatency`) with a plain `quantile()` or a `_bucket` / `by (le)` form | Use `histogram_quantile(0.99, {__name__="<metric>", …})` on the enriched delta histogram, or derive from spans in SQL |
| Latency off by 1000x | Unit mismatch — ALB `TargetResponseTime` and RDS `*Latency` are **seconds**; Lambda `Duration`, DynamoDB, EBS `VolumeAvg*` are **ms** | Convert explicitly |
| Alert fires twice as often as expected / cannot be retuned | Threshold comparison baked into the PromQL expression | Remove it; the threshold is a field on the condition ([../alerts.md](../alerts.md)) |
| Dashboard panel frozen or ignoring the time picker | Absolute time pinned in the expression | Keep panel queries windowless; let `scope` drive the range ([../dashboards.md](../dashboards.md)) |
| Panel shows nothing, no error | `queryLanguage` not set to `promql` | Set it explicitly — it is not inferred |

## 7. Where PromQL is used

PromQL is the metric language everywhere in Omni, not only for ad hoc queries:

- **Dashboards** — [../dashboards.md](../dashboards.md). Each `explore` panel takes a
  `queryString`, an explicit `queryLanguage` (`"promql"` for metrics, `"sql"` for
  log/trace content), `autoRun: true`, and `promqlQueryOptions.step` in seconds. Panel
  expressions are **windowless**; the `@`-labels are double-quoted PromQL and therefore
  JSON-escaped once more inside the `queryString`. The dashboard reference includes
  per-archetype panel templates (Lambda, EC2, ALB, RDS, Kubernetes) whose PromQL follows
  the conventions in this file.
- **Alerts** — [../alerts.md](../alerts.md). A condition on a metric must use
  `language: PROMQL`; the expression carries its own range selector (`[5m]`) and no
  threshold comparison. Metric alerts on a gauge, a counter rate, or a
  `histogram_quantile` percentile all go through this path; SQL alerts reach logs and
  traces only.
- **Ad hoc queries** — `StartTelemetryQuery` (`queryString` + `sessionId`) and
  `GetTelemetryQueryResults` carry no language or time-range parameter: the query
  string is always SQL, PromQL is accepted only embedded as
  `promql('<data set>', '<expression>', <step-seconds>)` with the window bound by that
  relation's `@timestamp` predicate, and metrics through this path are disabled per
  account at GA (section 1; section 4, "Time range binding"). Prefer a dashboard panel
  or an alert rule.
- **Views** — [views.md](views.md) are SQL over logs and traces; they do not wrap PromQL.

For the concepts behind Spaces, data sets, and access — which govern what an account's
PromQL can see — see [../concepts.md](../concepts.md).
