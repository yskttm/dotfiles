# AWS Observability

## Overview

Domain expertise for AWS observability across metrics, logs, and traces, for **two
products** that share the CloudWatch name but are separate services with separate
control planes, data models, and APIs:

| | CloudWatch | CloudWatch Omni |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Log groups, metric namespaces, alarms, Log Insights, X-Ray, Application Signals | Application Observability / Agent Observability. A **Space** per account per Region is the access boundary over the account's CloudWatch **Dataset** (OpenTelemetry logs, traces, and metrics); the Dataset is a CloudWatch resource the Space reads, not something the Space contains |
| **Control plane** | `aws cloudwatch`, `aws logs`, `aws xray`, `aws application-signals` | `aws cloudwatchomni` (endpoint prefix `cloudwatch-omni`, signing name `cloudwatch`) |
| **Query** | Log Insights query language; GetMetricData | SQL over `logs.default` / `traces.default`; PromQL over metrics; named views |
| **Notify** | Alarms (metric, composite, anomaly) | **Alerts** (SQL/PromQL rule, contributors, OK/WARNING/CRITICAL/NODATA) |
| **Topology** | Application Signals service map | **Context graph** (GetContextGraph) |
| **Access** | IAM only | Domain → Space → **access grants** and **access profiles** (set up in `setting-up-cloudwatch-observability`) |
| **Only here** | Dynamic Instrumentation, Synthetics canaries, CloudTrail auditing, EMF | Agent-quality evaluation, views, context graph |
| **References** | `references/cloudwatch/` | `references/cloudwatch-omni/` |

Enabling Omni does not replace CloudWatch; log groups, metrics, and alarms keep
working, and most customers use both.

**Works best with** the [AWS MCP server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mcp/) — enables
running CLI commands, querying CloudWatch, and validating configurations directly. All
guidance also works with standard AWS CLI access.

**Note:** Reference files contain specific runtime versions, quota values, and feature
matrices that may change. When precision matters (e.g. deploying to production, choosing a
runtime, or checking a quota), confirm values against current AWS documentation rather
than relying solely on the values in these files.

## Scope guard — is this an observability request?

This skill owns the scope decision for every request routed to it, and this section is
its sole home.

**If a request is NOT about AWS observability with CloudWatch or CloudWatch Omni
(weather, trivia, general chit-chat, non-observability coding), decline it in one
sentence: state plainly that it is out of scope, never fabricate an answer, and never
claim a false capability limitation (no "no internet access", no "no weather data") —
the reason is simply that it is out of scope. Then redirect by naming what this skill
does cover: querying CloudWatch and CloudWatch Omni logs, traces, and metrics, building
dashboards, configuring alerts, investigating a service, or agent evaluation.**

Do **not** attempt the off-topic task, and do **not** call a tool or run a query in
pursuit of it. Keep it brief: no lecture, no long refusal.

## Step 0 — CloudWatch or CloudWatch Omni?

Decide this before routing. The natural wording ("set up an alert for high latency",
"build a dashboard", "query my logs") does not say which product the customer means.

1. **The customer names the product** — "Omni", "Application Observability", "Agent
   Observability", a Space, Domain, Dataset, access grant, `spaceId`, `cloudwatch-omni`,
   Omni SQL, PromQL, views, context graph, evaluators, agent evaluation / scoring traces /
   online or continuous evaluation / `gen_ai.evaluation`, and OTel span vocabulary
   (`traces.default`, `logs.default`, spans, `durationNano`, `status.code`, resource
   attributes, `service.name`) → **Omni**. "Log Insights", "log group", "metric
   namespace", "CloudWatch alarm", "metric alarm", "composite alarm", "anomaly alarm",
   "X-Ray", "Application Signals", "canary", "CloudTrail", "Dynamic Instrumentation" →
   **CloudWatch**. A "log group" named inside an agent-evaluation request is the
   online-evaluation data source to verify, not a CloudWatch signal. A bare "alarm" (or "alert") with no other product
   signal is ambiguous — fall through to rule 3 and probe: a Space → Omni alert
   ([alerts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/alerts.md)); no Space → CloudWatch alarm
   ([cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md)). Exception: a "PromQL
   **alarm**" is a CloudWatch alarm on OTel metrics
   ([cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md)) — "alarm" wins over "PromQL".
2. **Knowledge or how-to question** ("what is an Omni alert", "does Omni have an API",
   "how do alerts differ from alarms") → answer from the reference files directly. Do
   **not** probe the account, and do not divert to the other product. Whether a
   capability exists is a fact about the product, not the account.
   [concepts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/concepts.md) carries the full feature-equivalence matrix.
2a. **Authoring / how-to alert request** — "create / set up / write an Omni alert that
   fires when X", "how should I alert on Y" — with no Space or Region supplied and no
   go-ahead to actually create it, is a **HOW-TO** request. Deliver the authoring guidance
   (the alert-authoring must-state checklist below, then
   [alerts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/alerts.md)) **FIRST**, from the reference files. Do
   **NOT** stall on a Region/Space clarifying question and do **NOT** fall back to a
   CloudWatch alarm for a request that explicitly says "Omni alert". Probe the account only
   once the user supplies a Space/Region or asks you to create it.
2b. **A telemetry object is already in the prompt** — the user pastes, or the UI passes as
   context, a span, trace, log record, or query result and asks what it means, what errors
   it has, or how long it took. This is **not** a live-data request: do not probe the
   account, run a query, or ask the user to fetch it again. Read it in place per the
   "Reading a span or trace you already have" section of
   [query/sql-logs-traces.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/sql-logs-traces.md) and
   state every item in its must-state list.
2c. **A query request whose live result is empty or unreachable** ("show me the slowest
   spans", "which traces failed") is still answered with the **methodology** — the exact
   query and the field rules that make it correct (see the must-state callouts in
   [query/sql-logs-traces.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/sql-logs-traces.md)). Zero
   rows, a wrong-Region Space, or an unreachable endpoint is reported as a finding
   alongside the query, never as the whole answer.
3. **Request that must act on live data, and the wording is ambiguous** (not a Step 0.5
   content question, which is answered from the catalog) → probe the target Region first:
   ```
   aws___call_aws → aws cloudwatchomni list-domains
   aws___call_aws → aws cloudwatchomni list-spaces        # scope to the target Region
   ```
   - You MUST state, when resolving the ambiguity or asking the user, that a Space is
     **one per account per Region**, so the probe (and any Omni query) targets the Region
     the request concerns — not just the default Region — because an Omni query against the
     wrong Region returns an empty result easily misread as "no data".
   - A Domain and a Space exist in that Region → **Omni**.
   - No Space → **CloudWatch**: alarms → [cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md),
     dashboards → [cloudwatch/dashboards.md](references/cloudwatch/dashboards.md), queries →
     [cloudwatch/log-insights.md](references/cloudwatch/log-insights.md), metrics →
     [cloudwatch/metrics.md](references/cloudwatch/metrics.md). If the customer explicitly asked
     for Omni and has no Space, that is a first-time setup — see step 4.
   - The probe itself errors ("not yet supported", unknown service, endpoint does not
     resolve) → the CLI/SDK model in use lacks `cloudwatchomni`. That is **not** evidence
     Omni is absent and must not be reported as "Omni is unavailable". The customer's
     installed AWS CLI/SDK most likely predates the service. If the request carried
     **any** Omni signal, give the customer the upgrade command to run (AWS CLI v2
     reinstall or `brew upgrade awscli`; `pip install -U boto3 botocore`) and have them
     re-run `aws cloudwatchomni list-domains` — exact steps in
     [programmatic-access.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/programmatic-access.md). **Never
     run a package-manager upgrade or installer on the host yourself** (`brew`, `pip
     install -U`, `.pkg`/MSI); it mutates the customer's machine beyond the request and
     can break unrelated tooling — hand over the command and continue with the guidance.
     Never substitute a CloudWatch or X-Ray command for an Omni request. If the request
     carried **no** Omni signal, do not block on the upgrade: proceed on the CloudWatch
     path (the pre-Omni default) and mention the upgrade only in passing.
   - Still inconclusive → ask the customer.
4. **First-time Omni setup** — creating a Domain or Space, granting access, provisioning
   ingestion, forwarding log groups into the Dataset, connecting Slack, or instrumenting
   an application or AI agent so traces reach a Space → **STOP and route to the
   `setting-up-cloudwatch-observability` skill.** This skill covers a Space that already
   has data. An instrumentation / ADOT / OTel-collector request that names neither
   Application Signals, ServiceEvents, or the `amazon-cloudwatch-observability` add-on
   nor Omni or a Space is ambiguous — probe `list-spaces` in the
   target Region: a Space → route to the `setting-up-cloudwatch-observability` skill's
   application-instrumentation reference (plain ADOT SDK, no add-on); no Space →
   [cloudwatch/application-signals-onboarding.md](references/cloudwatch/application-signals-onboarding.md).

**Under-specified alert requests:** When an alert or alarm request names what to watch (a
symptom or a service) but not the inputs it needs — the threshold value and the evaluation
period — ask for those rather than inventing them. Notifications are optional (per
alerts.md), so ask for a notification destination only if the user wants to be notified.
This holds on both paths (an Omni alert or a CloudWatch alarm).

**Under-specified dashboard requests:** When a dashboard request names what to show but not
which metrics, panels, or layout, ground those against the data and confirm the panel set
rather than inventing panels; a dashboard has no threshold, period, or notification. For ANY
dashboard authoring/save request, also open [dashboards.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/dashboards.md)
and surface its "Facts you MUST surface when building or saving an Omni dashboard" checklist
(see the dashboard must-state subsection below). Which signals or panels a named resource
type needs is a Step 0.5 catalog question, not a dashboards-file question.

### Step 0.5 — Service-health investigation (routing)

A large share of real questions are phrased as an operator symptom, not as a tool: "is my
`<service>` throttled / slow / erroring / unhealthy," "which of my `<service>`s are
`<symptom>`," "what's the health of my `<service>`," "what does `<service>` depend on and
which is broken," "what signals / what should be on a dashboard or view for `<service>`."
These are **observability-data questions — answer them from the telemetry surface, not
from the resource's control plane**, and answer with the *methodology* (the correct
signals, aggregation, scoping, and caveats) even when you also pull live numbers and even
when no matching resource exists in the account.

Route by the symptom, then **open the reference and surface every applicable item in its
"facts you MUST surface" checklist** — the checklist is the output contract, and it lives
in the reference file, not here:

- A **metric symptom about one AWS service** (throttling, latency, error rate, restarts,
  saturation, "what signals should it get", which signals or panels a named resource type
  needs on a dashboard or view) → [query/promql-metrics.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/promql-metrics.md).
  Open its **"Service-health question — facts you MUST surface"** section and surface every
  applicable item. Dashboard or view wording does not send this to either dashboards file
  (neither carries the signal facts) nor to rule 3's probe — it is a content question.
- **"What does `<service>` depend on / what's broken downstream" / blast radius / who is
  affected / which direction do I walk the graph / what do `CALLS`, `ACCESSES`, `RUNS_ON`
  mean** → [context-graph.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/context-graph.md). Open its
  **"Dependency / blast-radius question — facts you MUST surface"** section and surface
  every applicable item. A slowness or error symptom phrased in terms of the graph,
  dependencies, or edge types routes here, not to the metric bullet above.
- **Individual slow or failing spans / traces** ("slowest spans for `<service>`", "which
  traces failed") are trace **SQL**, not a metric aggregate →
  [query/sql-logs-traces.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/sql-logs-traces.md). Open its
  **"Span Duration"** and **"Finding failed spans"** sections and state every item in their
  must-state callouts — a request about a service's latency or error *rate* (an aggregate
  signal) is the PromQL bullet above instead.

### Authoring an Omni alert — surface the must-state checklist

When you author or advise on an Omni alert, open
[alerts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/alerts.md) and surface the items relevant to the task
from its **"Facts you MUST surface when authoring an alert"** section. That section holds
the per-item detail and is the source of truth, so state what fits the request rather than
restating it here.

### Agent evaluation — surface the must-state callouts

When a request is about scoring traces, choosing an evaluator, reading stored scores,
online/continuous evaluation, or evaluation datasets, open
[agent-evaluation.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/agent-evaluation.md) and state every
applicable item from its **"tell the user ALL of this"** callouts — level rules (one level
per call, the three level semantics, tool-call level needs tool spans), evaluator redirect
and ground truth, where scores are stored and the wrong-table read, and online-evaluation
data-source verification. The callouts are the output contract; the answer text must
carry them, not just the plan.

### Building or saving an Omni dashboard — surface the must-state facts

When you author, save, read back, or debug an Omni dashboard, open
[dashboards.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/dashboards.md) and surface the items relevant to
the task from its **"Facts you MUST surface when building or saving an Omni dashboard"**
checklist. That checklist holds the per-item detail and is the source of truth.

## Routing — CloudWatch Omni (`references/cloudwatch-omni/`)

Rows that **act on live Space data** assume Step 0 found a Space. Knowledge questions are
answered from the file directly.

| User need | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Concepts.** What Omni is, what a Domain / Space / Dataset / grant / profile / view / alert / context graph is, whether a feature is Omni or CloudWatch, where setup starts | Read [concepts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/concepts.md) |
| **Query logs or traces** — SQL (`SELECT … FROM logs.default / traces.default / default`), field access, schema discovery, slowest / failed spans (`durationNano`, `status.code`), TABLESAMPLE | Read [query/sql-logs-traces.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/sql-logs-traces.md). For slowest or failed spans, state every item in its "Span Duration" / "Finding failed spans" must-state callouts, even when the live result is empty |
| **A span, trace, or log record supplied in the prompt** — "I have this span open, what errors are in it", a pasted telemetry object | Read the **"Reading a span or trace you already have"** section of [query/sql-logs-traces.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/sql-logs-traces.md). Answer from the object's own fields; do not probe, query, or ask the user to fetch it |
| **Query metrics** — PromQL, which metric answers which symptom per AWS service, why a metric is missing, gauge vs counter | Read [query/promql-metrics.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/promql-metrics.md). Metrics are PromQL, never SQL |
| **Views** — create, manage, or query named reusable SQL (`FROM view.<name>`) | Read [query/views.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/query/views.md) |
| **Dashboards in Omni** — compose, ground panel queries, author `panels[]`, lay out the grid, the API save semantics (an unknown root- or panel-level key, a missing `type`/`layout`, or a bad variant is REJECTED at save with a 400 ValidationException; a bad enum VALUE, `x+w>60`, or an unknown key inside `config` saves 200 and fails or is ignored at render; validate before save), fix an empty or blank panel, the `*OmniDashboard` APIs | Read [dashboards.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/dashboards.md) |
| **Alerts in Omni** — any mention of an Omni **alert**, `CreateAlert` / `GetAlert` / `ListAlerts` / `UpdateAlert` / `DeleteAlert`, a `profileId`, an alert ARN, or how alerts differ from alarms; create, tune, tag, list, delete; notifications | Read [alerts.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/alerts.md). The alert API is real and first-class — do NOT redirect to CloudWatch alarms. For CloudWatch alarms when Omni is not enabled, read [cloudwatch/alarms.md](references/cloudwatch/alarms.md) |
| **Context graph** — why is service X slow or failing, what depends on it, upstream/downstream, which direction to walk, edge types `CALLS` / `ACCESSES` / `RUNS_ON`, blast radius, walking from an insight or anomaly to a root cause, `GetContextGraph` | Read [context-graph.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/context-graph.md) and state every applicable item in its "facts you MUST surface" section |
| **Agent evaluation** — score traces on demand, choose an evaluator, read back stored `gen_ai.evaluation.*` scores ("which evaluators are doing worst", "which online evaluators are unhealthy / underperforming"), build datasets from traces, set up online evaluation, author a custom evaluator, audit whether an agent's traces are flowing | Read [agent-evaluation.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/agent-evaluation.md) and state every applicable item in its "tell the user ALL of this" callouts |
| **Programmatic access** — "is there an API or SDK for Omni", calling Omni from code, CI, IaC, or an AI coding agent | Read [programmatic-access.md](references/cloudwatch-omni/programmatic-access.md). Omni has a real public SigV4 API; never answer that it has none, never substitute the CloudWatch or X-Ray CLI/SDK, and answer without probing for a Space |
| **Who has access to a Space**, granting or revoking access, access profiles, creating a Space or Domain, ingestion, forwarding, Slack, Azure, instrumenting an app or AI agent | Route to the **`setting-up-cloudwatch-observability`** skill |
| Spans multiple areas | Read the most specific reference first, then consult others as needed |
