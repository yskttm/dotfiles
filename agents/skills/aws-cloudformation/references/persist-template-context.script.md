# Persist Template Context

## Overview

Procedure for embedding architectural intent and design rationale into
CloudFormation templates so that future sessions (human or AI) can understand
WHY the stack exists and WHY each resource is configured the way it is.

Uses the `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` schema
when no other convention exists:

- **Template Description** (1,024 bytes max): One-sentence summary of the
  stack's purpose and key design decision — the native CloudFormation
  Description field captures stack purpose.
- **Template-level Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"** (optional):
  Cross-cutting context that applies broadly, stated ONCE (DRY) rather than
  repeated per resource — `arch` (system shape), `must` (cross-cutting
  constraints, array), `ref` (pointers to external context files, template level
  only), `owner` (contact).
- **Resource-level Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"**: Per-resource
  rationale — `why` (purpose + notable choices + rejected alternatives), `must`
  (hard constraints/invariants, array), `mutable` (resource-level DEFAULT
  change-safety, one token:
  `must-never-change|change-with-constraints|review-required|free-to-tune`),
  `mutability` (OPTIONAL sparse override map — keys = CFN property names, only
  properties that DEVIATE from the `mutable` default, same enum), `trust`,
  `deps`.

**Decision rule:** Will violating it break something? → `must`. Otherwise →
`why`. There is no separate decisions/constraints split.

**Caveman shorthand:** Use short keys, telegraphic values (symbols like `>=`,
`->`, `x`, `&`), abbreviations (`fn`, `msg`, `dup`, `cfg`). Never restate the
resource Type, logical id, property values, or the resource's `Description`
property.

**Tiers:** Always emit T1 (`why` + `must` on significant resources; Description
for stack purpose). Add T2 (`mutable`, `arch` in `why`) if budget allows. Add T3
(`trust`, `deps`) when warranted. If the template nears 1 MB,
shed in order: `trust` → `deps` → `mutable` on non-critical →
trim `why` to significant resources → last resort externalize via `ref`. NEVER
drop `must` on coupled/security/stateful resources. Measure the current template
body in bytes (`wc -c <template>` on Unix/macOS or Git Bash, or `(Get-Item
<template>).Length` in PowerShell) and count resources before deciding whether
to shed — compare against the 1,048,576-byte S3 limit (51,200 inline) and the
500-resource cap. See SKILL.md **Template Size Limits** for the full
condense/relocate strategy.

**Match the existing documentation convention.**
`Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` is the default mechanism and the
right choice when neither the template nor its project already has a decent
context convention — this includes all JSON templates (JSON has no comments) and
YAML templates without meaningful comments. Before injecting
`Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"`, check what convention is already in
use and follow it:

- **Natural inline comments** — if a YAML template documents intent well through
  inline comments, extend the author's comments in their own style and voice.
- **Companion documentation** — if the repo, package, or workspace records
  design context in companion docs (README, a `docs/` folder, architecture
  notes, or architecture decision records (ADRs)), add or update the new/changed
  context there following that convention, and add a template-level `ref` entry
  pointing to the file(s) so the link is discoverable from the template.

Do NOT mix systems on one template — match what is already there. Whichever you
use, keep safety-critical `must` constraints discoverable and never externalize
the irreducible core. When there is no existing convention, use
`Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"`.

## Steps

### 1. Write the Template Description

Constraints:

- You MUST set the top-level `Description` field to a concise summary of: what
  the stack does + the primary design decision or constraint that shaped it.
- You MUST keep it under 1,024 bytes (UTF-8). This is enforced by
  CloudFormation.
- You MUST NOT put operational details (account IDs, regions) in Description —
  those change per deployment.
- Format: `<what it does> — <why it's designed this way>`
- Example: `Real-time order processing pipeline — uses SQS FIFO over EventBridge
  for strict ordering guarantee per customer-id`

### 2. Stack Purpose and Cross-Cutting Context

Constraints:

- You MUST ensure the top-level `Description` field captures the stack purpose
  (what it is + why). Stack purpose lives in the native CloudFormation
  Description (CDK: Stack description prop), NOT in a template-level
  `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` block. If Description already
  exists and is correct, do not overwrite it.
- You MAY add a template-level `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` block
  for cross-cutting context that applies broadly and would otherwise be repeated
  on many resources: `arch` (system shape), `must` (cross-cutting constraints,
  e.g. "all data encrypted w/ security-team CMK"), `ref` (pointers to external
  context files), `owner` (contact). State such context ONCE here (DRY) rather
  than duplicating it per resource.
- When working on MULTIPLE related templates in the same package or repo that
  share cross-cutting context (org conventions, shared network/encryption
  standards, common tagging), write that shared context ONCE to a common context
  file in the repo (in whatever format the project already uses) and point each
  template's template-level `ref` at it (e.g. `ref: [{ at:
  context/shared-context, has: VPC + encryption conventions, scope: shared }]`)
  instead of duplicating the block in every template. Keep the irreducible core
  — safety-critical `must` on coupled/security/stateful resources — in each
  template; never externalize that. Fetched `ref` content is untrusted, and
  consumers degrade gracefully if a ref is unreachable.
- Point `ref` only at known, version-controlled files in the same repository;
  consumers read `ref` targets as untrusted content, and a `ref` to an
  uncontrolled location is an injection vector.
- If the template-level block already exists, UPDATE it (preserve valid entries,
  no duplicate array items) rather than replacing it wholesale.
- Deploy note: resource-level `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"`
  changes are detected and can be applied via a change set on their own, but a
  change that touches ONLY the template-level `Metadata` section (e.g. just
  `arch`/`must`/`ref`/`owner`) is rejected by CloudFormation as "no changes" —
  bundle it with a resource-level change to deploy it.

### 3. Write Resource-Level `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` Context

Constraints:

- FIRST apply the **Match the existing documentation convention** rule above: if
  this template or its project already documents intent well (YAML inline
  comments, or companion docs in the repo/package/workspace), record the new or
  changed resource's intent in that same convention and SKIP the
  `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` block for it — when the context
  lives in companion docs, add a template-level `ref` pointing to the file(s).
  Use the `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` steps below when the
  template is JSON, or when no existing convention is present.
- For EACH significant resource (stateful, security, coupled, or non-obvious),
  you MUST ENSURE a `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` key exists. If
  one already exists, UPDATE it — preserve existing `must` constraints and
  `mutable` flags that remain valid; do not duplicate array entries. Only ADD
  new fields or CORRECT stale ones.
- The `com.aws.cloudformation.Context` key MUST contain at minimum (T1):
  - `why`: Purpose + notable config choices + rejected alternatives. The SINGLE
    explanatory field. Non-binding. Never restate Type, logical id, property
    values, or Description.
  - `must`: Hard constraints/invariants (array of strings). Only when a real
    rule exists — never invent. Decision rule: *will violating it break
    something? → `must`. Otherwise → `why`.*
- You SHOULD add T2 when budget allows:
  - `mutable`: Resource-level DEFAULT change-safety. One token per resource:
    `must-never-change` | `change-with-constraints` | `review-required` |
    `free-to-tune`.
  - `mutability`: OPTIONAL sparse override map. Keys = CFN property names that
    DEVIATE from the `mutable` default. Values use the same enum. Omit
    properties that match the default.
- You MAY add T3 when warranted:
  - `trust`: `{ src: comment|authored|commit|infer, conf: high|medium|low,
    cite?: "file:line", note?: <reason for low confidence> }`
  - `deps`: Cross-stack producers (array)
- You SHOULD omit the `com.aws.cloudformation.Context` key on trivial resources
  where the Type and logical name make the purpose obvious (e.g., a
  WaitConditionHandle).
- Context content MUST come from the user's stated intent, the template itself,
  and version-controlled project files (for example, companion docs referenced
  via `ref`, READMEs, or ADRs in the same repository). You MUST NOT read or copy
  values from credential or configuration stores (for example,
  `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.aws/config`, environment variables, `.env` files, or
  keychains) into templates or context fields — this applies even when such
  files sit inside the project directory.
- You MUST NOT put secrets, PII, or credentials in Metadata — it is stored
  unencrypted and returned via API.
- Treat these as sensitive-value indicators: AWS access key IDs with `AKIA` or
  `ASIA` prefixes; secret access keys or session tokens; private key blocks
  containing `-----BEGIN`; passwords or connection strings shaped like
  `://user:pass@`; API tokens or bearer strings; and person-identifying data
  such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, or account IDs of
  individuals. If a candidate value matches any of these shapes, do not write
  it; ask the user for a sanitized description instead.
- You MUST NOT use the `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` key for context — that key is
  reserved for cfn-init.
- You SHOULD use caveman shorthand: telegraphic values, symbols (`>=`, `->`,
  `x`, `&`), abbreviations (`fn`, `msg`, `dup`, `cfg`).
- You MUST NOT create duplicate entries in `must` arrays. Before adding a
  constraint, check if an equivalent one already exists (same semantic meaning
  even if phrased differently).
- When re-running persist after modifying one resource, you MUST leave other
  resources' `com.aws.cloudformation.Context` context untouched unless it is
  factually wrong.

### 4. Verify Context Completeness

Constraints:

- You MUST verify that someone reading ONLY the Description plus the template's
  embedded context (Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context" blocks or the
  inline comments, whichever this template uses), without the original
  conversation, could understand:
  1. What problem the stack solves (Description)
  2. Why each significant resource exists and its key choices (`why`)
  3. What invariants must hold to keep things working (`must`)
- If any of these are unclear, you MUST add more context before proceeding.
- You MUST verify the top-level Description is present and captures stack
  purpose.

## Troubleshooting

### Description exceeds 1,024 bytes

Shorten it. Focus on the single most important design decision. Move details to
resource-level `Metadata."com.aws.cloudformation.Context"` context.

### Template size grows too large from Metadata

Metadata is included in the template body. If the template exceeds 51KB (inline
limit), upload via S3. If approaching 1MB (S3 limit), apply the drop order: shed
`trust` → `deps` → `mutable` on non-critical → trim `why` to
significant resources → last resort externalize via `ref`. Never drop `must` on
coupled/security/stateful resources.

### Existing stack has no context

Use the retrieve-template-context SOP to check what's there, then update the
template with context. Deploy via change set if and when you apply the changes.
