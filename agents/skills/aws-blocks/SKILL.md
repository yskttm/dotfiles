  Guides building full-stack applications with AWS Blocks — an Infrastructure-from-Code
  framework. Applies when creating APIs, selecting Building Blocks (KVStore, DistributedTable,
  Database, AuthBasic, AuthCognito, Realtime, AsyncJob, FileBucket, etc.), running
  local development, or deploying AWS Blocks applications. Also covers AWS Blocks
  topics with validated, version-specific patterns that prevent common mistakes. Triggers
  when user mentions AWS Blocks; project has aws-blocks/ directory; code imports @aws-blocks

# AWS Blocks Application Development

> **Package naming:** All packages are published under the `@aws-blocks` scope (e.g., `@aws-blocks/core`, `@aws-blocks/blocks`, `@aws-blocks/bb-kv-store`).

## Overview

AWS Blocks is an Infrastructure-from-Code framework where Building Blocks bundle CDK, SDK, and local mocks into a single API. It provides 18+ Building Blocks covering storage, authentication, real-time communication, background jobs, file management, AI/search, email, and observability — all working locally without AWS credentials.

**Key characteristics:**
- One `aws-blocks/` directory defines the entire backend
- Frontend imports are fully typed — no client generation needed
- All Building Blocks work locally without AWS (mocks persist to `.bb-data/`)
- Deploy ephemeral, individual testing environments with `npm run sandbox` and long-lived environments with `npm run deploy` using least-privilege credentials

## Framework model (how a Blocks app fits together)

These are the load-bearing facts about how a Blocks app is wired. They prevent the most common agent mistakes; none are guessable from general React/Node/AWS knowledge.

- **Backend defines the API; the frontend imports it, fully typed.** You write methods in `aws-blocks/index.ts` and call them from the frontend:

  ```ts
  import { api, authApi } from 'aws-blocks';
  const todos = await api.listTodos();          // typed, awaited call
  ```

  At runtime that import resolves to an auto-generated **client proxy** (`aws-blocks/client.js`), not the server module — the types come from your backend, the transport is injected. **The JSON-RPC transport is invisible: never build request payloads by hand or `fetch()` the API directly** (only for one-off connectivity troubleshooting). Just import the namespace and call the method.
- **Pitfall:** do not `import ... from '../aws-blocks/index.ts'` in a script/test to call the API — that gives you the *server* definition object, which behaves differently from the client. Import from `'aws-blocks'` (the package name).

### Methods are namespaced

A call is always `namespace.method(...)` — e.g. `api.createTodo(title)`, `api.listTodos()`. The namespace is the string you passed as the **second** argument to `new ApiNamespace(scope, '<name>', …)`. A bare method name with no namespace will not resolve. (Auth is the same shape but pre-built: `authApi` exposes `getAuthState`/`setAuthState` — sign-up is `authApi.setAuthState({ action: 'signUp', … })`, not a bare `signUp`.)

### Auth is a Building Block, not hand-rolled

Get the current user inside a method with `await auth.requireAuth(context)` (throws if unauthenticated). On the frontend, mount the ready-made UI from `@aws-blocks/blocks/ui`:

```ts
import { Authenticator, onAuthChange } from '@aws-blocks/blocks/ui';
authContainer.appendChild(Authenticator(authApi));
onAuthChange(authApi, (user) => { /* re-render for signed-in/out */ });
```

Sign-up auto-confirms (no email round-trip) when the auth block is constructed without a `codeDelivery` callback. **This is a local/dev convenience only — it accepts an account without verifying ownership of the email.** For production, pass a `codeDelivery` callback so sign-up requires email verification.

### How the deployed frontend reaches the backend

The deployed browser fetches `/.blocks-sandbox/config.json` at runtime to discover the API base (`{"apiUrl":"/aws-blocks/api"}`), which CloudFront proxies same-origin to API Gateway — no CORS to configure, no endpoint to hardcode. The "is the frontend wired to the backend?" check is `curl <cloudfront-url>/.blocks-sandbox/config.json`, not `/config.json` (which returns an S3 `NoSuchKey`). This is a public-facing surface: see **Security Considerations** below for the CloudFront security headers, `requireAuth` on mutating methods, explicit `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and the WAF / API Gateway throttling to add before exposing it in production.

## Scaffolding a New Project

```bash
npx @aws-blocks/create-blocks-app my-app
cd my-app
```

### To add AWS Blocks to an existing project:

```bash
npx @aws-blocks/create-blocks-app .
```

This detects the existing project and adds an `aws-blocks/` workspace alongside your code.

### To add AWS Blocks to an Amplify Gen 2 project:

```bash
npx @aws-blocks/create-blocks-app .
```

When the CLI detects `amplify/backend.ts`, it automatically integrates AWS Blocks with your Amplify backend.

### With a specific template:

```bash
npx @aws-blocks/create-blocks-app my-app --template demo
cd my-app
```

### Available Templates

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `default` | Vite + lit-html starter app with basic authentication, data persistence, and realtime to help demonstrate basic app architecture and patterns (used when --template is omitted) |
| `bare` | Vite + lit-html starter with a single "hello world" API method and a bare frontend |
| `react` | React + Vite starter with a single API endpoint and typed React frontend |
| `backend` | Backend-only — no frontend, just the AWS Blocks API with a single endpoint |
| `demo` | Todo app with AuthBasic, KVStore, DistributedTable, Zod schemas, indexes, and auth-protected CRUD |
| `auth-cognito` | Full AuthCognito passwordless email-OTP with roles, device management, and Authenticator UI |
| `nextjs` | Next.js + React starter with AWS Blocks backend integration (SSR + Server Components) |

## Development Workflow

After scaffolding, refer to **node_modules/@aws-blocks/blocks/README.md** for the complete development workflow including:
- Core concepts (Architecture, Building Block selection)
- Project structure and Scope organization
- Error handling patterns
- Schema validation
- Local development
- Best practices and common mistakes
- Deployment IAM role setup and security guidance

When implementing a specific Building Block, read its package README for the detailed API reference (e.g., `node_modules/@aws-blocks/bb-kv-store/README.md`). These are the authoritative docs for your installed version.

## Security Considerations
- Use `await auth.requireAuth(context)` in every method that shouldn't be public — ApiNamespace methods are **unauthenticated by default**
- Use `new AppSetting(scope, id, { secret: true })` for API keys and credentials — never hardcode or use `.env` files
- Always attach a schema to KVStore/AppSetting that accepts user data — the RPC layer validates structure but not business logic
- Do not add broad `*` IAM policies — each Building Block already grants least-privilege scoped to its own resources
- Never change `blockPublicAccess` on FileBucket — serve public files through CloudFront instead
- Configure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` explicitly for production — avoid wildcards
- For cross-domain deployments, pass `crossDomain: true` to auth constructors (enables `SameSite=None; Secure; Partitioned`)
- Enable `monitoring: { enabled: true, snsTopicArn: '...' }` on Hosting for production alerts
- Add WAF and API Gateway throttling via CDK for public-facing apps — not included by default
- Logger provides serialization safety (circular refs, type coercion) but does NOT redact sensitive content — never pass raw credentials, tokens, or secrets to Logger methods; sanitize context objects before logging
