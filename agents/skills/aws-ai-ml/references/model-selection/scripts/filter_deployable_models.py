"""
Filters deployable models based on constraints from a use case spec.

Usage:
    python filter_deployable_models.py <models_json_file> [constraint:value ...]

Behavior:
    Models are excluded when they lack metadata for a filtered field OR when
    their metadata positively mismatches a constraint. Only models with matching
    metadata for every applied filter are included in results.

    Multiple values for the same key are OR-ed together. For example:
        size:1b size:1b-10b size:7b
    matches models with ANY of those sizes.

    Different keys are AND-ed together. For example:
        size:1b-10b task:text generation
    matches models that have size 1b-10b AND task text generation.

Constraints (all optional, repeatable):
    task:<value>            - Match against 'tasks' field (substring match)
    data_type:<value>      - Match against 'data_types' field (substring match)
    input_modality:<value> - Match against 'input_modalities' field (substring match)
    output_modality:<value>- Match against 'output_modalities' field (substring match)
    license:<value>        - Match against 'license' field (substring match)
    size:<value>           - Match against 'size' field (exact match)
    context_window:<value> - Match against 'context_window' field (exact match)
    language:<value>       - Match against 'languages' field (substring match)
    model_type:<value>     - Match against 'model_type' field (exact match)
    provider:<value>       - Match against 'provider' field (substring match)
    bedrock:<true|false>   - Filter by Bedrock eligibility
    name:<value>           - Match against model 'name' (substring, case-insensitive)

Example:
    python filter_deployable_models.py models.json "task:text generation" "size:1b" "size:1b-10b"

def sort_models_newest_first(models):
    """Return models sorted deterministically, newest first.

    The ordering is total and stable, so identical input always produces
    identical output:

      1. Models WITH an ``original_creation_time`` come before models that lack
         one. Undated models are pushed to the end.
      2. Among dated models, sort by ``original_creation_time`` DESCENDING
         (most recent first). Creation times are ISO 8601 strings, which
         compare correctly lexicographically.
      3. ``name`` ASCENDING (case-insensitive) is the tie-breaker applied
         throughout. It orders dated models that share a creation time AND
         alphabetizes the undated group among themselves at the end. So if
         four models are undated, all four sit at the end of the list sorted
         A -> Z relative to each other.

    Implementation note: we split into dated/undated groups and use Python's
    stable sort with two passes (name ascending, then time descending), rather
    than a single composite key. This avoids comparing ``None`` to strings and
    avoids any per-character math on the timestamp: ISO 8601 strings of
    DIFFERENT lengths (e.g. with vs. without fractional seconds, since
    ``datetime.isoformat()`` omits microseconds when they are zero) compare
    correctly as-is under ``reverse=True``, whereas a per-character inversion
    would let a shorter string become a prefix of a longer one and sort wrong.

    Args:
        models: List of model dicts.

    Returns:
        A new sorted list (the input list is not mutated).
