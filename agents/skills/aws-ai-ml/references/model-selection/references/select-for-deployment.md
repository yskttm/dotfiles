# Select for Deployment

Select a base model to deploy by filtering the catalog against the user's `use_case_spec.md`.

## Prerequisites

- A `use_case_spec.md` file exists with a **Deployment Constraints** section. If not, activate the `use-case-specification` skill first.

## Step 1: Discover Available Filter Values

Run: `python3 model-selection/scripts/get_deployable_models.py <hub-name> --list-values`

This returns a JSON object showing all unique values available for each filterable field in the catalog. For example:

```json
{
  "tasks": ["text generation", "image classification", "translation", ...],
  "sizes": ["<=10b", "11b-70b", "71b-100b", ">100b", "unknown"],
  "data_types": ["text", "vision", "audio", "multimodal", "tabular"],
  ...
}

```

## Step 2: Map Soft Constraints to Hard Filters

Read `use_case_spec.md` and extract the **Deployment Constraints** section. These are natural language preferences from the user.

> **ENFORCEMENT — read before mapping.** Apply these rules in order:
>
> 1. **Use ONLY the tables below.** Do not infer filter values from your own
>    knowledge of model sizes, tasks, or context lengths, and do not substitute
>    "close enough" values. The tables are the single source of truth, so the SAME
>    user words always produce the SAME filter set every run.
> 2. **Unmapped term → ASK.** If a constraint term is not listed below, ask the
>    user a clarifying question rather than guessing.
> 3. **Ambiguous term → offer options.** If a term is ambiguous (e.g. "qa" =
>    *question answering* or *quality assurance*), ask and offer the mapped
>    categories to choose from (e.g. "task options: chatbot/assistant,
>    summarization, classification, translation — which fits?").
> 4. **"any" / "don't care" → no filter** for that field.
> 5. **Pass each value in a cell as its own argument** with the same key; the
>    filter OR-s values within a key.

### 2a. Size — soft term → exact `size` value

`get_deployable_models.py` normalizes every model into one of five canonical size
buckets (`<=10b` / `11b-70b` / `71b-100b` / `>100b` / `unknown`). The four below
are the selectable values; `unknown` means the model's size could not be
determined — it is excluded by any size filter and has no soft-term mapping.

| If the user says… | Use exactly |
|---|---|
| small, tiny, lightweight, cheap, low-cost, smallest | `size:<=10b` |
| medium, mid-size, moderate | `size:11b-70b` |
| large | `size:71b-100b` |
| very large, huge, biggest, largest | `size:>100b` |

### 2b. Task — soft term → exact `task` value(s)

Task tags in the hub overlap and are matched by substring, so use these exact
OR-lists (do not shorten them — e.g. bare `task:classification` wrongly matches
image/tabular/token classification).

| If the user wants… | Use exactly |
|---|---|
| chatbot, chat, assistant, conversational, customer support | `task:text generation` `task:generation-text` |
| summarize, summarization, summaries | `task:text generation` `task:generation-text` |
| classify, classification, categorize | `task:text classification` `task:classification-text` |
| translate, translation | `task:translation` |
| code, coding, programming | `task:text generation` `task:generation-text` — then tell the user that code-focused models are not separately tagged; to find them, look for the `codellama`, `qwen-coder`, `starcoder`, or `granite-code` families by name |

> Note on summarization: the hub's dedicated `text summarization` /
> `summarization-text` tags are almost entirely older short-context (≤4k)
> seq2seq models (BART/Pegasus/DistilBART) that mostly lack a `context_window`
> value — so filtering on them (especially combined with a long-context
> constraint) returns few or zero usable models. Capable long-document
> summarizers are general instruction-tuned LLMs tagged `text generation` /
> `generation-text`, which is why "summarize" maps there.

### 2c. Context window — soft term → exact `context_window` value(s)

| If the user says… | Use exactly |
|---|---|
| short, small context | `context_window:<4k` `context_window:4k-8k` |
| medium context | `context_window:8k-32k` |
| long, long documents, long context | `context_window:32k-128k` `context_window:>128k` |
| very long, largest context | `context_window:>128k` |

> Unlike `size`, `context_window` is NOT normalized by the script — it is stored
> and matched verbatim, and the table above assumes the hub's buckets are exactly
> `<4k` / `4k-8k` / `8k-32k` / `32k-128k` / `>128k`. Before applying a
> context_window filter, confirm the value(s) appear in the `context_windows` list
> from the Step 1 `--list-values` output. If the hub's buckets differ (e.g. a new
> value like `16k`), use the matching value(s) from that list instead of a value
> from this table — do NOT filter on a bucket that isn't in the catalog, or the
> result will be silently empty.

### 2d. Other fields — exact mappings

| Field | If the user says… | Use exactly |
|---|---|---|
| Data type | text | `data_type:text` |
| | image, vision | `data_type:vision` |
| | audio, speech | `data_type:audio` |
| | multimodal | `data_type:multimodal` |
| | tabular | `data_type:tabular` |
| Model type | open source, open weights | `model_type:open_weights` |
| | proprietary, closed | `model_type:proprietary` |
| Deployment target | Bedrock | `bedrock:true` |
| | SageMaker, either, unspecified | *(no filter)* |

### 2e. Concrete fields — user names the value directly

For **license, language, provider, model name**, and **modalities**, do not use a
lookup table — the user names a concrete value. Match it against the Step 1
`--list-values` output using substring matching (e.g. "apache" matches both
`apache 2.0` and `apache-2.0`). If the named value is absent from the catalog,
tell the user rather than substituting a different one.

**General rules:**

- If the user said "any" or "don't care" for a field, do not create a filter for it.
- If a term is not covered by the tables above, is ambiguous (like "qa"), or is not
  a concrete value the user named, ASK a clarifying question — and list the relevant
  mapped options so the user can choose (for tasks: chatbot/assistant, summarization,
  classification, translation; for size: small, medium, large,
  very large). Do not guess.

Present your resolved mapping to the user for confirmation before filtering:

> "Based on your preferences, I'll filter with these criteria: [list each mapping]. Does this look right?"

⏸ Wait for user confirmation. If they disagree, adjust — but only to other values that exist in the tables above or the Step 1 catalog values.

## Step 3: List Models and Apply Filters

Run: `python3 model-selection/scripts/get_deployable_models.py <hub-name> > /tmp/deployable_models.json`

Then run the filter script with the resolved filter values:

```
python3 model-selection/scripts/filter_deployable_models.py /tmp/deployable_models.json <filter1> <filter2> ...

```

After filtering, report:

> "Based on your constraints, I applied these filters: [list each]. This narrowed [total_models] models down to [matched] candidates."

## Step 4: Handle Results

### If results are non-empty (≤20 models)

The filter script returns models in a fixed, deterministic order: **newest
first** (by original creation date, descending), with model name (A→Z) breaking
ties and any models lacking a creation date placed last (also A→Z). **Present
the models in exactly the order the script returned them — do NOT re-sort,
re-group, or reorder by size, name, license, or relevance.** This guarantees the
same constraints always produce the same ordered list.

Present all matching models. Cross-reference with `references/model-licenses.md` for license links where available. Display each model on its own line, preserving script order:

```
<model name> — <size_raw> | <license> | Bedrock: ✓/✗

```

For the size column use the model's `size_raw` field (the actual parameter count,
e.g. `7b`) when present — it is more informative than the normalized `size`
bucket. Fall back to `size` only if `size_raw` is absent. Omit fields that are unknown rather than showing blanks. **Display every matching model — completeness is required.**

Ask the user to select:

> "Which model would you like to deploy?"

⏸ Wait for user selection. Once the user selects a model, **proceed immediately to Step 5** (do not confirm or hand off yet).

### If results are non-empty but large (>20 models)

Show the first 20 (the 20 newest, since the script returns newest-first — preserve script order), state how many total matched, and ask:

> "There are [matched] models matching your constraints. Here are the first 20. Would you like to see more, or would you like to tighten your constraints to narrow further?"

### If results are empty

Re-run the filter script with one constraint removed at a time to identify which filter is most restrictive (eliminates the most models). Report:

> "No models matched all your constraints. The most restrictive filter was [field]: [value], which eliminated [N] candidates. Would you like to relax this constraint?"

If the user agrees, adjust the filter and re-run from Step 3. If they want to change their use case spec, activate the `use-case-specification` skill, then re-run from Step 1.

## Step 5A: Select Instance Type

Once the user selects a model, use the AWS API `describe-hub-content` (SageMaker service) with:

- `HubName`: the hub name from Step 1
- `HubContentType`: "Model"
- `HubContentName`: the selected model name

From the response, parse the `HubContentDocument` JSON and determine the instance type:

### If `InferenceConfigs` exists (labeled configs):

The model has pre-configured hosting profiles optimized for different use cases. Each config name follows the pattern `<use-case>_<optimization>`, e.g.:

- `generate_best_price_performance` — balanced cost/speed for text generation
- `summarize_lowest_latency` — fastest for summarization tasks
- `interact_lowest_cost` — cheapest for interactive/chatbot use
- `max_context_best_price_performance` — best value for long-context inputs

Each config includes `BenchmarkMetrics` with latency and throughput per instance type.

**Recommend a config** based on the user's use case from `use_case_spec.md`:

1. Match the use-case prefix (`generate`, `summarize`, `interact`, `max_context`, `modify`) to the user's task.
2. Default to `best_price_performance` optimization unless the user expressed a preference for speed (`lowest_latency`) or cost (`lowest_cost`).
3. Use the `DefaultInferenceInstanceType` from the matched config component as the instance type.
4. Present your recommendation with the benchmark metrics:

> "For your use case ([task]), I recommend the **[config_name]** hosting configuration on **[instance_type]** ([latency] latency, [throughput] throughput). There are [N] other configurations available if you'd like to optimize differently. Would you like to proceed with this, or see other options?"

⏸ Wait for user confirmation or selection.

### If `InferenceConfigs` does NOT exist (no labeled configs):

The model has basic hosting info only. Collect ALL available instance types from both sources:

1. `SupportedInferenceInstanceTypes` — the top-level list
2. `HostingInstanceTypeVariants.Variants` — keys in this object are instance families or specific instance types (e.g., `g5`, `ml.g5.2xlarge`) that also support the model

Merge both into a single candidate set (union, deduplicated). The `HostingInstanceTypeVariants` often contains smaller/cheaper instances not listed in `SupportedInferenceInstanceTypes`.

From the merged set, select the **cheapest** instance type as the default recommendation. Consider both:

1. **Instance family** (cost tier): `g4dn` < `g5` ≈ `g6` < `g6e` < `p4d` < `p5`
2. **Instance size** (suffix): `xlarge` < `2xlarge` < `4xlarge` < `12xlarge` < `24xlarge` < `48xlarge`

Pick the cheapest family available, then the smallest size within that family.

**Important:** A hosting config entry (with `ResourceRequirements`, `ImageUri`, etc.) is NOT required to recommend an instance. If an instance family appears in `HostingInstanceTypeVariants` with just an `ImageUri`, that is sufficient — the model can run on it. Do not bias toward instances that have a more detailed config. Always recommend the cheapest option regardless of whether it has a full config or just an image URI.

Present:

> "For this model, I recommend starting with **[cheapest_instance]** (the most cost-effective supported instance). Other supported options from smallest to largest: [list]. Would you like to proceed with this, or choose a different instance?"

⏸ Wait for user confirmation.

---

## Step 5B: Resolve Hosting Configuration

> ⚠️ Do NOT proceed to Step 6 until you have completed this step. The user confirming an instance type does NOT mean the step is done.

Now that the instance type is confirmed, resolve the hosting configuration:

1. Check `RecipeCollection` entries in the `HubContentDocument`. Within each recipe, look at `HostingConfigs` — an array of objects keyed by `InstanceType`.
2. Find an entry where `InstanceType` matches the confirmed instance (e.g., `ml.g5.2xlarge`).
3. If a match exists, it contains deployment-specific settings (`EcrAddress`, `Environment`, `ComputeResourceRequirements`, `Profile`). Record this as the hosting config.
4. If no match in `RecipeCollection`, check `HostingInstanceTypeVariants.Variants` for the instance family (e.g., `g5`). This may contain `ImageUri` or environment variable overrides.
5. If neither has a config for the selected instance, record that no hosting config was found.

---

## Step 6: Hand Off

Emit a flat deployment config with exactly these three fields:

- [ ] `model_id` — the selected Hub model ID.
- [ ] `instance_type` — the user-confirmed instance type.
- [ ] `inference_config_name` — the config name the user **confirmed** in Step 5A (the one you
      recommended, or a different one they chose), e.g. `generate_best_price_performance`, so
      deployment deploys THAT config instead of the SDK's top-ranked default. This is required
      whenever the model has labeled `InferenceConfigs`: because the instance type was derived from
      this config, omitting the name lets deployment pick a different (top-ranked) config for which
      the chosen instance may be unsupported. If the user switched to a different config, make sure
      the `instance_type` you hand off is that config's `DefaultInferenceInstanceType` (re-derive
      it), so the pair stays consistent. Set it to `null` ONLY on the Step 5A "no labeled configs"
      path.

Do NOT hand off the image URI / environment / `ComputeResourceRequirements` resolved in Step 5B —
the serving container and environment are re-resolved from `inference_config_name`, so Step 5B stays
a validation step (confirm a hosting config exists for the chosen instance) and its output is not
part of the hand-off. Do not emit the role ARN, region, or endpoint/model naming either — those are
set at deployment time, not here.

If any of the three fields is missing, go back and resolve it before proceeding.

Return to Step 4 of the main SKILL.md (Confirm Selection) with these outputs.
