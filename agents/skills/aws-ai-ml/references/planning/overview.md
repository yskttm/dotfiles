## Principles

- **One question at a time.** Each question should resolve a branching decision in the plan. Avoid generic or out-of-domain questions.
- **Surface constraints early.** If a user decision would constrain downstream options, flag it before the plan is finalized.
- **Keep plans short.** Only include tasks that are necessary for the user's stated goal.
- **Don't ask what you already know.** Check conversation history and project files before asking the user.

## Phase 1: Brainstorming

**Goal:** Understand what the user wants to accomplish and identify which references belong in the plan.

Read `references/input-output-contracts.md`, `references/model-customization-plan.md`, `references/evaluate-first-plan.md`, and `references/deploy-base-model-plan.md` to:

- Determine whether the user's request aligns with an existing plan template. If exactly one matches, offer it. If multiple could apply, present the relevant options with brief pros/cons and ask the user to choose. If no template matches but the request involves multiple steps, propose a custom plan adapted to the user's needs. If the user declines a plan, proceed directly with their request using available references and general knowledge.
- Identify which references could be relevant to the user's stated goal.
- Check whether the user has the necessary input artifacts for each reference. If not, find the references that generate those inputs and add them first.
- Order references to allow a smooth transition from one to the next and avoid dead ends.
- Check if a recommended workflow matches the user's needs. If not, assess what modifications are needed and verify they are possible against the contracts table.
- Decide which references in a matching workflow can be skipped.
- Surface limitations early — if a user decision (model choice, region, evaluation method) would constrain downstream options, mention it proactively, get user feedback, and adapt the plan accordingly.

**During brainstorming:**

- **Serverless customization region gate (check FIRST).** If the user's request involves fine-tuning or model customization, AND their region is already known (stated in their message, or stored in conversation context from a prior sdk-getting-started run), check it against the supported regions in `references/region-availability.md`. If the region is NOT supported, STOP immediately. Do NOT ask about evaluate-first vs direct fine-tuning. Do NOT generate any fine-tuning plan. Instead, tell the user the blocking message from `references/region-availability.md` (substituting their region).

  If the region is not yet known, continue to the workflow choice gate — the pre-execution region check below will enforce this constraint before any fine-tuning task runs.

- **Workflow choice gate:** Before generating any plan, determine which workflow the user needs. There are three paths:

  1. **Deploy a base model** — the user wants to select and deploy a model from the catalog without fine-tuning.
  2. **Evaluate-first** — the user wants to evaluate a base model before deciding whether to fine-tune. Always present this option alongside direct fine-tuning, even if the user says "I want to fine-tune" — the user may not know evaluate-first exists.
  3. **Direct fine-tuning** — the user is committed to fine-tuning a model.

  **Disambiguation for "deploy":** If the user says "I want to deploy a model" (or similar), first determine whether they want to deploy a **fine-tuned model** they already have, or deploy a **base model** as-is:

  - If they already have a training job or fine-tuned model → this is NOT the deploy-base-model path. Proceed with the existing workflow and the `model-deployment` reference will handle it as a later step.
  - If they want to select and deploy a base model without fine-tuning → this IS the deploy-base-model path. Read `references/deploy-base-model-plan.md`.
  - If unclear and no prior context exists, ask: "Do you have a model you've already fine-tuned, or would you like to select and deploy a base model from the catalog?"

  If the user has explicitly chosen a path (e.g., "evaluate first", "skip evaluation", "deploy a base model", "I already fine-tuned"), proceed with their choice. Otherwise, present the relevant options with brief pros/cons and ask the user to choose. Saying "fine-tune" or naming a technique alone is NOT an explicit choice to skip evaluation — the user may not know evaluate-first is an option. Do NOT present a plan until the user has chosen a path. After they choose, read ONLY the corresponding reference plan.

- Use the Restrictions column of the contracts table to flag constraints as soon as the relevant decision is made. Examples (non-comprehensive list, check contracts table for the full picture):
  - User picks a Nova model → alert that deployment regions are limited.
  - User picks a region → alert if it conflicts with model availability.
- If a restriction applies, check whether it requires changes to other steps in the plan.
- Do NOT ask the user about base model selection or preferences. Model selection is handled exclusively by the `model-selection` reference.
- Move to Phase 2 as soon as you can determine which references and tools the plan needs.

## Phase 2: Plan Generation

**Goal:** Propose a structured plan for the user to review.

Generate a plan as a numbered list of tasks. Each task has:

- A short name
- A one-sentence description of what happens
- Which reference handles it (if applicable)

**Format:**

```
Based on what you've described, here's what I propose:

1. ⬜ **[Task Name]** — [What happens]. *(Reference: [reference-name])*
2. ⬜ **[Task Name]** — [What happens]. *(Reference: [reference-name])*
3. ⬜ **[Task Name]** — [What happens]. *(Reference: [reference-name])*

Does this plan look right, or would you like to change anything?

```

**Rules for plan generation:**

- Infer ordering from the Prerequisites column in the contracts table — a skill cannot appear before its prerequisites. If unsure, consult `references/skill-routing-constraints.md`.
- Prefer existing references when they cover the user's need. When no reference matches part of the request, proceed with general knowledge while respecting skill boundaries.
- Tailor the plan to the user's actual intent. Not every plan needs every reference.
- If the user already has input artifacts (e.g., a trained model), skip the steps that produce them.

When the user approves the plan, write it to `PLAN.md` and save it under the project directory structure defined by the directory-management reference.

```markdown
# Plan

1. ⬜ **[Task Name]** — [Description]. _(Reference: [reference-name])_
2. ⬜ **[Task Name]** — [Description]. _(Reference: [reference-name])_
3. ⬜ **[Task Name]** — [Description]. _(Reference: [reference-name])_

```

**Status indicators:**

- ⬜ Not Started
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Completed

Update `PLAN.md` whenever a task's status changes.

---

## Phase 3: Plan Iteration

**Goal:** Refine the plan until the user approves it.

- If the user suggests changes, regenerate the plan incorporating their feedback.
- If the user approves, begin execution by handing off to the first task's reference.

---

## Execution

Once the plan is approved:

1. **Pre-execution region check (MANDATORY for fine-tuning plans).** If the plan includes any fine-tuning step, immediately check the user's region by running:
   ```
   python -c "import boto3; print(boto3.session.Session().region_name)"
   ```
   If the result is `None`, skip this check and continue — the sdk-getting-started skill will prompt the user to set a region later. Otherwise, check the region against the supported regions in `references/region-availability.md`. If it is NOT supported → STOP. Do NOT start executing the plan. Tell the user the blocking message from `references/region-availability.md` (substituting their region). If it IS supported → briefly confirm to the user that serverless model customization is available in their region (e.g., "Your region (`<region>`) supports serverless model customization ✅") and continue.

2. Before starting a task, update its status in `PLAN.md` to 🔄 (In Progress).
3. If the task maps to a reference, load that reference's overview.md before doing any work. Do not attempt the task from general knowledge — always defer to the reference's instructions.
4. Execute the task by following the loaded reference's workflow.
5. When the task completes:
   - Update its status in `PLAN.md` to ✅ (Completed). If the task generated output files (scripts, notebooks, manifests), record the file paths under the completed task:

     ```
     - [x] Fine-tune model
       - Output: `scripts/01_sft_finetuning.py`
       - Output: `manifests/sft-llama-20260515.json`

     ```

   - Briefly confirm completion and move to the next task.
6. If the user interrupts with a new request mid-execution:
   - Completed tasks are immutable — do NOT modify them.
   - Regenerate the remaining tasks to incorporate the user's new input.
   - Present the updated remainder for approval before continuing.

---

## Plan Completion

When all tasks in the plan are done:
Present to the user:

> "We've completed everything in the plan. What would you like to do next?"

This re-enters Phase 1 (Brainstorming) for a new goal. There is no terminal state — the conversation continues as long as the user wants.
