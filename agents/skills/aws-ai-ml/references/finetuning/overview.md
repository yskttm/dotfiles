# Finetuning

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow, verify:

1. A `use_case_spec.md` file exists
   - If missing: Load the `use-case-specification` reference first, then resume
   - DON'T EVER offer to create a use case spec without loading the use-case-specification reference.

2. A fine-tuning technique (SFT, DPO, RLVR, RLAIF, or CPT/RFT (for Nova)) and base model have already been selected
   - If missing: Load the `model-selection` and/or `finetuning-technique` references to collect what's missing, then resume
   - Don't make recommendations on the spot. You MUST load the appropriate reference.

3. A base model name available on SageMakerHub has been identified
   - If missing: Load the `model-selection` reference to get it
   - **Important:** Only use the model name that `model-selection` retrieves, as it may differ from other commonly used names for the same model

4. The SDK environment has been verified (SDK version, region, execution role)
   - If not done: Load the `sdk-getting-started` reference first, then resume

5. The region supports serverless model customization
   - Check the environment's region against `../planning/references/region-availability.md`. If it is NOT supported, STOP and give the user the blocking message from that file — do not proceed with fine-tuning. (This is normally enforced by the planning skill, but is repeated here in case fine-tuning is reached without it.)

6. A training dataset uploaded to a bucket in the environment's default region.
   - If not met: Help the user upload the dataset to the correct S3

### Out of Scope

The following are supported by SageMaker and AWS but do not have a validated workflow in this reference. If the user's request matches one of these, let them know and proceed with best-effort guidance using general AWS knowledge:

- Pre-training or creating a model from scratch
- Bring-your-own container/algorithm training
- Server-ful (non-serverless) SageMaker training jobs
- HyperPod training
- Traditional ML training (XGBoost, scikit-learn, custom algorithms)

## Critical Rules

### Code Generation Rules

- ✅ Use EXACTLY the imports shown in each code template
- ❌ Do NOT add additional imports even if they seem helpful
- ❌ Do NOT create variables before they're needed in that section
- 📋 Copy the code structure precisely - no improvisation
- 🎯 Follow the minimal code principle strictly
- ✅ When writing code, make sure the indentation and f strings are correct

### User Communication Rules

- ❌ NEVER offer to move on to a downstream reference while training is in progress (logically impossible)
- ❌ NEVER set ACCEPT_EULA to True without explicit user confirmation in the conversation
- ✅ Always mention both the number AND title of sections you reference
- ✅ If user asks how to run (notebook): If `run_cell` is available, offer to run it. Otherwise, tell them to run cells one by one (mention ipykernel requirement).
- ✅ If user asks how to run (script): Tell them to run with `python3 <script>.py`

## Workflow

### 1. Code Generation Setup

#### 1.1 Directory Setup

1. Identify project directory from conversation context
   - If unclear (multiple relevant directories exist) → Ask user which folder to use
   - If no project directory exists → load the **directory-management** reference to set one up

⏸ Wait for user.

#### 1.2 Select Code Template

Read `references/code_output_guide.md` for output format rules, then read the code template matching the finetuning strategy:

- SFT → `code_templates/sft.py`
- DPO → `code_templates/dpo.py`
- RLVR → `code_templates/rlvr.py`
- RLAIF with built-in rewards → `code_templates/rlaif_builtin.py`
- RLAIF with custom prompt → `code_templates/rlaif_custom_prompt.py`

The template is a Python file where each `# Cell N: Label` comment marks the start of a new section. Split on these markers — everything between one marker and the next becomes one unit of output.

#### 1.3 Generate Code

1. Write the code from the template following the rules in `code_output_guide.md`
2. Use same order, dependencies, and imports as the template
3. DO NOT improvise or add extra code
4. If the model is **NOT** a Meta/Llama model (model ID does NOT start with `meta-`):
   - Omit the `ACCEPT_EULA = False` line from the config cell
   - Omit the `accept_eula=ACCEPT_EULA,` line from the trainer call
5. If the model is from the Nova family, omit any code containing `max_epochs` or `lr_warmup_steps_ratio` from the Configure Trainer section and the Hyperparameter Overrides section

#### 1.4 Auto-Generate Configuration Values

**In the 'Setup & Credentials' cell, populate:**

1. **BASE_MODEL**
   - Use the exact SageMakerHub model name from context

2. **MODEL_PACKAGE_GROUP_NAME**
   - Generate from use case (read `use_case_spec.md` if needed)
   - Format rules:
     - Lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens only
     - 1-63 characters
     - Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9](-*[a-zA-Z0-9]){0,62}`
     - Example: "Customer Support Chatbot" → `customer-support-chatbot-v1`

3. Save notebook

### 2. RLVR Reward Function (for RLVR only, skip this section if technique is SFT or DPO)

#### 2.1 Check Reward Function Status

- Ask if user has a reward function already, or would like help creating one.
  - If user says they have one → Ask for the SageMaker Hub Evaluator ARN. Only proceed to Section 2.3 once the user provides a valid Evaluator ARN. If they don't have it registered as a SageMaker Hub Evaluator, continue to 2.2.
  - If user says they do not have one → Continue to 2.2

#### 2.2 Generate Reward Function From Template

1. Follow workflow in `references/rlvr_reward_function.md` section "Helping Users Create Custom Reward Functions"

#### 2.3 Set CUSTOM_REWARD_FUNCTION value

1. Set the value for `CUSTOM_REWARD_FUNCTION` in the Notebook with the ARN of the reward function (either given directly by the user, or from the function generation code as `evaluator.arn`).

### 3. RLAIF (for RLAIF only, skip this section if technique is not RLAIF)

Read `references/rlaif_guide.md` and follow its instructions.

### 4. EULA review and acceptance

1. Look up the official license link for the selected base model from references/eula_links.md
2. Display the license to the user following the phrasing in references/eula_links.md. For OSS models: "This model is licensed under **{License}**. Please review the license terms here: {URL}." For Nova models: "This model is subject to the AWS Service Terms: {URL}."
3. Check if the selected base model is a Meta/Llama model (model ID starts with `meta-`)
   - **If Meta/Llama**: Tell the user they must read and agree to the EULA before using this model. Ask: "Do you accept the license terms? (yes/no)". If the user confirms, set `ACCEPT_EULA = True` and uncomment `accept_eula=ACCEPT_EULA` in the generated notebook. If the user declines, leave `ACCEPT_EULA = False` and warn that training will fail without acceptance.
   - **If non-Meta**: Inform the user of the license for their awareness. No code-level action needed — the `ACCEPT_EULA` variable and `accept_eula` parameter should already be omitted from the notebook (see Step 1.3).

### 5. Post-Generation

After generating the code, offer to run it. Training can take hours depending on your dataset and model.

**Notebook mode:** If `run_cell` is available, offer to run the cells. Otherwise tell the user to run cells themselves.

**Script mode:** Present the user with options:

> "Would you like me to:
>
> 1. Leave it to you — run with `python scripts/[script_name]`
> 2. Run it and wait until it's done
> 3. Start it but don't wait — we can check status later"

- **Option 1:** Done. Wait for user to come back.
- **Option 2:** Execute the script as-is. `trainer.train(wait=True)` blocks until complete. Report final status.
- **Option 3:** Change `wait=True` to `wait=False` in the script, execute, report the training job name.

**Checking status:**

- `describe-training-job --training-job-name NAME` → `TrainingJobStatus`, `FailureReason`, `SecondaryStatusTransitions`
- For model package ARN after completion: `list-model-packages --model-package-group-name GROUP_NAME --sort-by CreationTime --sort-order Descending --max-results 1`

**Showing results after completion:**

- Use `scripts/mlflow_reference.py` as the pattern to query MLflow metrics
- Present loss by epoch as a text table (total_loss, val_eval_total_loss for SFT; rewards/margins for DPO; critic/rewards/mean for RLVR)

**CRITICAL:**

- DON'T suggest moving to next steps before training completes
- DON'T elaborate on the next steps unless the user specifically asks you about them.

### 6. Continuous Customization

If the user wants to finetune a model they had already customized, follow the instructions in references/continuous_customization.md
